0,1,Sha_la_la,Let’s stay safe!,5,2020-08-29 19:07:06,I’m glad we have this in addition to the diary app. Doesn’t run down my battery like I thought it would.
1,2,bhehr1,Not mainstream,1,2020-11-22 19:50:02,"I know the developer will respond negative to my review but in Wyoming this app isn’t even being used. We have caught COVID and the health department wasn’t interested in using this. This is in its infancy stage. Not ready for mainline use until the developer works with state and local government to incorporate this. As of now if gives you a good idea your safe but in reality it’s a false sense of safety. Still unknown what it really tracks and what data information it mines and to whom
It sends it to. I did delete the app and the government with my iPhone does enough spying and tracking on me already I don’t need anything else to worry who’s harvesting and selling my data."

4,5,ND-Guy,Pointless -ND dept of health doesn’t use it properly,1,2020-10-01 17:19:32,When I was interviewed by the department of health after contracting COVID the interviewer didn’t even mention the app. i told him that I had the app and asked if I could give him the code. He took the code but the button that is supposed to share my information with other users never enabled. What a waste of time and money by the state.
