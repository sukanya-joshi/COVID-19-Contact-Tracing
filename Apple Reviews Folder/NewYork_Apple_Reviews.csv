0,1,Bill1492,"I am a careful PhD computer scientist, and just installed it!",5,2020-10-01 23:58:00,"Recently, I went to a virtual conference, that included talks on coved tracking phone applications, and found this well thought out, safe to use without leak of date to advertising or personal privacy violated by tracking your every move. It uses blue tooth to make brief connection to people you are in blue tooth range, and sends encrypted messages to a secure server.  Should you, or someone else, contract COVID, the case will be asked if their phone blue tooth contacts can be notified.  If so they are send encrypted messages, suggesting you get tested and monitor your self.  It really only works if enough people install it that new cases can mostly automatically get contacts, even people on a cross town bus you don‚Äôt know notified.  I installed it for you, I hope you will install it for me!"
1,2,QualityPlease,Impressed with this app,5,2020-10-02 01:52:15,"It took just a couple of minutes to set up the app and the directions and information was very nicely presented. Privacy is fully protected. Nobody gets your name if you get an alert, so it‚Äôs just up to you to use it and get tested. Perfect for privacy paranoid New Yorkers. Also has nice daily data on number of cases. Hope enough people use it to have some effect."
2,3,Armygurl1997,The only down side I see,4,2020-10-26 16:46:02,I Live in Poconos in PA and you would be surprised how many families from NY and NJ I see getting out of cars to go into the stores in this area before hitting the hotels and ski or water park areas. Some have summer houses here and come up over the summer and hunt in the winter. If these apps were all contented with even CT I would say we have a bit better app here. You would be surprised how many PA residents get on busses in the morning to go to NYC jobs and drive to jobs in NJ. Wouldn‚Äôt you feel better if you knew the hillbillies and hippies of PA were ‚ÄúSafe‚Äù. When I worked in NYC I know I would. How‚Äôs my PA app going to interface with yours. This should have been a National App. I love near an interstate that goes from NYC to SF. It‚Äôs just a pipe line. Your stuff comes from somewhere.
3,4,Beckadermis,Won‚Äôt finish set up,1,2020-10-01 19:18:16,"I would love to contribute to this tracking app to keep us all safe‚Äîespecially because I live in one current hot spot and work in another. Unfortunately, it won‚Äôt finish the set up. It gets stuck in a continuous pop up window that says ‚ÄúSorry, please try again. Check that you have a network connection.‚Äù I‚Äôm currently on WiFi, have 5 bars on my cell connection and have location services turned on, so I don‚Äôt know any way to provide more network than that. 
There‚Äôs also no real app developer support. Links from the App Store or from the app just take you to the general info page of NYSDOH. 
So...good luck everyone. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
4,5,TimAnderson27,Just Moved to NYC,5,2020-10-04 00:30:57,"I just moved to NYC and was super scared about getting Covid. This app, if enough people download it, will be able to accurately tell me if I‚Äôve been by someone who tested positive. That way I can quarantine and make sure I don‚Äôt hurt the people I love.

This app uses Apple and Googles PRIVATE framework and I am sure they have done everything in their power to make sure it doesn‚Äôt store any of my sensitive material."
5,6,flipper1378,Private and no fuss,5,2020-10-02 18:31:42,"This app does not collect location data. It is well thought-out and provides a good overview of relevant COVID-19 information in addition to helping you know if you‚Äôve been near someone who has recently tested positive. The more people who install this and enable Exposure Notifications, the better these notifications will work."
6,7,Logamos,"Good app, uses the Exposure framework",5,2020-10-02 01:54:50,"It‚Äôs months late‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm very glad that the NYS app at least uses the Apple & Google collab framework. This won‚Äôt wear down your battery or leak any personal medical or location data. 

Keep safe. Keep your community safe. Download this now.

BUG REPORT: App doesn‚Äôt respect the bottom Safe Area. You can even see the problem in the App Store screenshots."
7,8,Starafish,Easy to read,5,2020-11-08 05:05:07,"My county has the most confusing Covid statistics. Their website is very concerned with how many people have recovered which is GREAT but I‚Äôm also looking for the same metric everyone else uses, how many new cases a day. This app gives me this info. I hope more people will download it so that we have an anonymous alert system."
8,9,Insert Your Nickname Here Please,Great and lifesaving tool,5,2020-10-01 20:37:16,"This app is easy to use and goes beyond its primary purpose of contact tracing /exposure notifications, also including a symptom log and the most up-to-date data on Covid infection rates and cases in NYS or by county. There‚Äôs a great demo explaining how the technology works (Bluetooth!). I hope many people download it, as it has the potential to literally save lives."
9,10,Tomak00,Simple and Safe,5,2020-10-02 12:14:24,Very simple app that will make me feel a little safer. Doesn‚Äôt ask you for any personal information and serves just to warn of any possible exposure so you can keep your family safe or make you go get tested if you‚Äôve been possibly exposed. Everyone should have this so we can breathe a little easier.
10,11,Eugene Pagano,Will work ‚Äî if enough people use it,5,2020-10-02 17:46:22,"This app does NOT use location tracking, only the Bluetooth technology that people use for wireless connections, such as wireless earbuds. 

It even works with devices having some other states‚Äô apps, such as NJ and PA.

It will be effective to reduce the spread only if many pause it.  Do so as a matter of community responsibility!"
11,12,Xt3m,An app to share! (Suggestion),5,2020-11-08 18:47:56,"I love this app and this really needs to be spread around. I just wanted to suggest that on the NY Covid Data screen, it would be fantastic if we could choose the time scale. I would like to be able to compare the numbers from November with September, however the app limits you to a month of hindsight."
12,13,Jacob Ford,Would love more info,5,2020-10-03 02:48:57,"App is simple and nice. Pleasant dashboard of county-level test data as well.

Would love to see a running tally of other phones it‚Äôs detected, or browse my list or close contact codes to confirm everything‚Äôs working. Otherwise, happy my state is tapping into public, well-integrated APIs instead of rolling their own."
13,14,CalmDown72,Nicely Done,5,2020-12-09 13:53:17,This is a very informative and useful app that becomes more and more effective as additional users are added. Just think how quickly we could beat this thing if everyone in the US with a smartphone had something like this on their phones!
14,15,Claudio914,App looks good!,5,2020-10-02 01:35:38,"App looks good and I hope that it helps everyone.

Question - any plans to adjust the app so it can be used by folks with older devices that can‚Äôt upgrade to iOS 13?  If not, I fear that will result in a fairly significant portion of the population who won‚Äôt be able to use the app."
15,16,xGhostShadowx,I want to like this app but....,1,2020-10-02 17:28:22,"I want to like and use this app because the concept is intelligent and could be helpful in mitigating transmission anonymously. The problem is that the app drains battery power very quickly. My phone was fully charged at home and by the time I got to work a little over an hour later I was down to 50%. That never happens. 

For me to use this app it needs to not have such heavy battery drain. I had to delete it from my phone which now makes this great app useless. Please fix."
16,17,techcat1,The most important app a NYer can get,5,2020-10-12 18:34:14,"This app will provide a huge boost to our contact tracing program. In my experience it is incredibly easy to use, uses very little battery, and does not encroach on privacy at all as it only uses Bluetooth. Huge fan."
17,18,soyouwanttobecanadian,I‚Äôm doing my part,5,2020-10-04 01:14:22,"I wear my mask ( over both my mouth AND nose) for you and now I downloaded this app for you too, and I hope you will return the favor. 
This will only work if we all download it and allow for alerts. Wouldn‚Äôt you want to know?"
18,19,RickyMtnez,Best place to check County by County stats,5,2020-12-09 19:11:52,"One of my favorite features is the ability to check county-by-county stats to see how my county is faring vs the state.  It‚Äôs easy to check daily test positivity, total daily confirmed cases and total # of people tested.  

You can‚Äôt really get this info easily elsehwre without checking Twitter and an array of websites.  

The ap is also helping me track my daily health and symptoms.  Looking fwd to seeing how this app develops.  

In meantime, making sure all my friends / colleagues have this app.  You should too!"
19,20,AYSIN-NYC,‚úåüèªGood App,5,2020-10-01 23:53:07,I hope everyone will download the app and help to stop the spread of Covid-19. It is a community health program and we all should feel responsible about it. The way to get rid of the coronavirus problem is acting together and caring for each other.
20,21,Yanks242,Have been using for months - great app,5,2020-12-09 15:07:05,The app is a great resource for info on the latest COVID numbers in New York and it‚Äôs so reassuring to know that I have a tool in my pocket to help me stay safe whenever I leave my apartment. Highly recommend downloading it!
21,22,Munashi,Anonymous and functional,5,2020-10-01 10:42:26,App does NOT require location data or any identifying information to work. Seems to work in the background just fine. Nice option to have.
22,23,Mark Saf,Safety with Privacy,5,2020-10-03 19:43:27,"What a wonderful and rare combination: like peanut butter and chocolate. Such a clever way they made it using digital tokens: you don‚Äôt need to know who had it, you just need to know you were near them. Kudos."
23,24,cmc2022,Covid app,5,2020-12-09 14:19:52,Love getting the updated county numbers daily. Also blue tooth makes it privacy sensitive so if you get covid it tells your contacts over 14 days. Would be great if everyone used it.
24,25,BrooklynsVeryOwn,Good App,5,2020-10-02 15:31:16,"Loving it so far. Best of all it doesn‚Äôt need your location, only bluetooth which is great. Also heard it works in some other states! I would recommend."
25,26,wtbhikgdjjbhllm,Seems like a good effort,5,2020-10-02 12:44:53,I like that the app does not store data and is explicit about how it works. It‚Äôs a simple interface. I like that there‚Äôs in app monitoring of cases in the state and my county with easily understood numbers.
26,27,Bgtgood,Don‚Äôt know yet if it works but yay!,5,2020-10-01 18:31:53,Been waiting forever for a safe secure application that uses the Google and Apple contact tracing api‚Äôs!! Finally this app will let me sleep a little better at night!
27,28,livrstrat,the right thing to do,5,2020-10-09 09:20:08,"If you live in New York, please install this app and enable blue tooth so we can all have the most and best possible information about our exposure. Be safe!"
28,29,Alejandropf44,Easy set up & secure,5,2020-10-03 01:12:16,"It took a while, but it‚Äôs finally here. No need for opening an account and easy to use."
29,30,Miraleh,Location settings does not work,3,2020-10-01 23:53:30,"I had to download and delete the app 3 times before it installed correctly on my iPhone.  Kept getting message that I was not connected to internet, when my WiFi strength was excellent."
30,31,jay5r,Uses a lot of battery,3,2020-12-12 22:24:57,"I had it installed but then noticed it was one of the primary reasons my battery was getting drained, so I uninstalled it. If I went out more I‚Äôd keep it installed because it‚Äôs a good idea. But the battery use is a problem IMHO."
31,32,Brooklyn mom of one and a cat,So glad NYS finally has one!,5,2020-10-04 14:59:44,"I've been waiting for this app for awhile. Much more convenient than Novid, one of the early apps."
32,33,GoJetSet,Has anyone even gotten an alert yet?,1,2020-10-22 20:47:47,"With all the people I‚Äôm around , mass transit, work groups , friends , family, shopping and activities  etc ... I have not yet received one alert , blue tooth is on , background app refresh etc .. not once have I gotten an alert . Has anyone gotten an alert and what does it look or sound like ?"
33,34,Tim Van,Thank you for respecting our privacy,5,2020-10-02 01:47:50,"Open source, privacy respecting software to help us move on."
34,35,hero2know,Seems ok,3,2020-12-04 02:51:03,"Seems simple enough to report symptoms without disclosing the personal stuff, but I think it would work better if more New Yorkers were actually aware of it and used the app."
35,36,bunkrich,Thank you!,5,2020-10-02 05:26:06,Thank you for getting this going. Hopefully everyone gets on board!
36,37,Michael3259,COVID-19 is far from over,5,2020-10-02 12:00:22,"Granted, NY State I doing well, but this app will help keep our numbers low, unlike many other states in the nation."
37,38,steff782,Omg finally,5,2020-10-02 03:40:38,"Superficially seems fine, or better than expected for government software. Uses apple api thank goodness"
38,39,Justin_Kuang,Best contact tracing app,5,2020-10-01 19:52:45,This app is amazing. Had it for about a day- super useful and helpful. Wish every state built something similar. Bravo New York!
39,40,Dan's man,Great app for everyone,5,2021-01-05 16:02:12,Only improvement would be to use it in vaccine distribution.
40,41,Tpixelminer,Please just downlaod this,5,2020-10-03 11:51:29,It literally takes 2 minutes and protects us all. Stay strong New York ‚úä
41,42,VTMarin,So easy to use,5,2020-10-02 01:48:25,"Very easy to load and use.  Gives me comfort to have this for me and others. 

Thanks NY State!"
42,43,Last.Dead.Mouse,Great App,5,2020-10-05 14:38:40,Simple concept and easy to use. This will save lives and should be rolled out nationally ASAP.
43,44,Brian/NYC,Consumes too much battery,1,2020-10-29 14:22:27,"On an iPhone Pro 11, iOS 14.1, consumes too much battery power (averages 9%). Plus, Cuomo isn't saying how many people are using the app or promoting it enough. And most importantly, they need to remind people who test positive with Covid (or just have symptoms) to actually report it in the app!"
44,45,treMD,No reason not to.,5,2020-10-02 11:34:51,"Just do it, and pull your mask up off your chin."

46,47,Jokewriter,Thank You Governor  Cuomo,5,2020-10-01 23:05:27,"You‚Äôve protected all New Yorkers, and thus remarkable app is just one example of your leadership . I‚Äôm proud of you and Proud be a New Yorker!"

48,49,aov201,Excellent,5,2020-10-27 16:14:12,This app is well designed and easy to use!
49,50,Zimsboy,It takes a community,5,2020-10-02 17:04:10,"If you‚Äôre a New Yorker, download this app"
50,51,GlobalMusic,Easy to set up and use,5,2020-10-01 13:22:50,Everyone in New York should use this.
51,52,Human0000,Better late than never + questions,3,2020-10-02 08:06:09,Not clear on how the app will know if people around you are sick or were tested positive??? Is it self reporting in the app ? Please comment. Thanks
52,53,Anna T 10,Good app,4,2020-10-02 00:40:34,"I like the app, but additional data for the current trends in my area would give me more incentive to engage with the app daily."
53,54,Snacky listener,Everyone in NY should use this to help stop the spread,5,2020-12-08 20:12:44,So easy and informative.
54,55,Sharon1986122416,Great app,5,2020-10-01 17:10:36,Thank you New York State for creating this app and helping to keep everyone even safer.
55,56,Mark Rochefort,Very Resourceful App,5,2020-10-01 22:55:22,This is a very resourceful app and gives you peace of mind when it comes to COVID-19 and awareness.
56,57,JMPNY,Simple to use - but terrible drain on battery.,4,2020-10-27 15:00:33,I‚Äôm using an iPhone 12Pro and I‚Äôm seeing ~25% battery utilization.
57,58,Albert Lawson,Does it need to be open?,2,2020-11-26 15:37:01,There‚Äôs no explanation. Does the app need to be open in the background all the time? If it‚Äôs closed is it still tracking? What‚Äôs the deal?
58,59,##anonymous##,Great app,5,2020-10-23 05:25:30,Easy to use. Interesting stats. A good way to contact trace!
59,60,mamas148484848,Awesome idea,5,2020-10-03 02:06:42,With the uptick I feel more secure having this app.
60,61,Sct9239113,Informational and important,5,2020-10-01 17:46:19,I love that it includes graphs to track the spread of COVID in my region
61,62,AA 3388,? Battery hog,2,2020-10-04 14:41:51,I‚Äôm not sure how well this works as an application but it uses a lot of battery power.

63,64,ed342,Battery drain,1,2020-12-15 18:21:04,Had no battery issues until I downloaded this app. Please fix. Exposure Notifications at 58%. Uninstalled.

69,70,ayydrewsky,Covid Positive,1,2020-11-26 18:43:09,"Had this app installed to protect myself and got COVID anyways. No alerts, no notifications, nothing."
70,71,scgordosr,This app needs work,1,2020-12-23 17:40:53,THIS APP DRAINS MY BATTERY IM NO LONGER USING IT IM CHANGEING 3times a day
71,72,SLC_Doc,Great but wish it showed positivity by zip code too,5,2020-10-21 14:20:44,If it could show my zip code then i would see positivity rate at 8 percent not 1.8%. And maybe that would make more people more preventative. Love this app.
72,73,allie92679,Only works if NY COVID TRACERS CALL YOU,1,2020-12-12 06:23:15,"Only works if NY COVID TRACERS CALL YOU!!! The covid tracers are taking over a week to ten days to call COVID positive people.  I know of many people who haven‚Äôt received any calls and it‚Äôs been over 2 weeks.  This app cannot work without a code that the tracer gives when u have a positive diagnosis.   By the time that happens, you probably already found out you had COVID cause you are sick, or your loved one is sick and you unknowingly passed it to someone.  This app is USELESS!  Especially when the virus is spreading like wildfires and CUOMO is too busy with his own public agendas, than to actually admit failure to control the spread and do something about it."
73,74,Cris099999,false advertisement,1,2020-11-15 15:45:02,how is this app 17 years old if supposedly covid initiated in 2019-2020
74,75,"Isabella, Destroyer Of Worlds","Open source, respects privacy",5,2020-10-10 16:35:35,"This app doesn't track your location, lets you double check that it doesn't by viewing the source code, and even if you decide to use the exposure logging tool (the most innovative part of the app), you won't share your identity or receive anyone else's identity information; they'll/you'll just be told what day they were close to somebody with the virus. You can delete these codes too at any time (although I would advise against it until the virus is over for the sake of public health), so if you stop feeling comfortable with the app, you can completely wipe your presence in it off the face of the earth. 
There are exactly two problems, in my opinion:
1. This app doesn't support iOS 12 and below, so people who can't afford the latest iPhones (a huge swath of the population) can't use the app, and
2. Despite the fact that we border Quebec and have some Qu√©b√©cois immigrants/visitors, the app does not support the French language. 
I would have expected the app to support all of EFIGS, honestly...but at the very least, french could be helpful.
Regardless, you'll note that my only criticisms of the app are related to not enough people having it.
I downloaded this app for you. It would be very kind of you to download it for me.
