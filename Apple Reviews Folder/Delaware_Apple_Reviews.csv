0,1,Raghos,Newer versions hide the check-in,4,2020-10-17 23:09:31,"This app is generally nice. In the initial few versions, the “Covid check in” was the first thing a user would see. Fast and easy. 

During a recent update, a new “Covid check in” tab was created at the bottom. This is a usability regression. Now the user has to find that, and click twice to get to the point where she can report whether they have symptoms. 

Please change it back so that the “do you have symptoms?” Prompt is the first thing a user will see when opening the app."
1,2,towncryr474,SURVEY LACKS FEEDBACK,4,2020-10-09 22:21:06,"The survey lacks an area to write down improvements to the app. I would like the questions when u set up to ask if u have been tested, results and how many times tested. Would give a better picture. Thanks"
2,3,SickandSuffering,Operates perfectly,5,2020-10-05 12:04:02,We need everyone in DE and anyone visiting to download this app to help contract trace.  It could be the answer to stopping the spread of Covid by anonymously alerting those who’ve been in contact with someone who’s recently tested positive.  The technology on your phone doesn’t work without these individual state sponsored apps.  Do it to prevent another quarantine!
3,4,Ddddd37479585,Good overall but buggy occasionally?,3,2020-09-17 01:31:54,"As of 9:28pm ET Sep 16, it shows 0% feeling good and 0% with symptoms, while total user is growing beyond 13k.

The numbers looked more believable in the morning.

Is there a bug ? Would such problems be avoided if the app is developed more closely with Apple ? How about supporting exposure notification api to reduce potential reliability problems? We cannot afford too many missteps more."
4,5,mudspinner108,"Is good, but could be more",4,2021-01-11 18:31:37,"I think it would be beneficial if in addition to checking in for covid symptoms; if you could also schedule covid tests AND, track your test results."
