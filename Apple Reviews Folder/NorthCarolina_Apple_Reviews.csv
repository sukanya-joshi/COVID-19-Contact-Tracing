0,1,KC1974,Good on NC DHHS,5,2020-10-04 09:45:46,"This is obviously dependent on everyone having the app and them reporting. That said, if they catch covid, if they’re a good citizen they should install it and report, but that’s pretty much locking the door after the horse has bolted, but it would be something. Also, with me living very close to the SC border who don’t have an app, I’m not so sure this will work that well. Add to that apartment/condo or townhouse living and a neighbor you have had no contact with reporting, you could get notifications because their phone is the other side of the wall, but it’s better than nothing. Realistically, the CDC should have had a national app. Why they don’t may be due to budget cuts? Who knows. Still - as I said it’s better than nothing and kudos to NC state dept of health for getting this out. Seemingly one of the few states that bothered."
1,2,Dww1588,Great Idea. Advertise it more!,5,2020-10-25 10:16:25,An exposure notification app seems like a great idea. But this app is only useful when lots of people have it. So why has it been out a month and I am just hearing about it at tje bottom of a story on WLOS? I was just at doctor last week and no one mentioned it. Asking GPs and others to tell their patients to download the app seems like a low cost way to spread the word!
2,3,alamcarter,Great app if you could actually report a positive test,2,2021-01-10 04:21:44,"Love the idea of the app but in order to report a positive test you need a pin. You can’t request one online which leaves you to have to call. Ok not a huge deal but is another step. Next issue is that because the case count is so high you can’t get the pin till they verify your positive test. After 4 days and still not being in their system we gave up reporting it. Fortunately the 2 in my family were only around me and we were under quarantine already so no one else was exposed. 
Fortunately my eldest who spread it to us was able to have it confirmed and got the pin but no luck for the other 2."
3,4,Tri2MakeADifference,Hope this app goes VIRAL,5,2020-09-24 12:25:06,"Prior to this app coming out, downloaded the app for Virginia and the other states that have similar. Really worth getting them all as they should alert you on travelers as well. 

Living in Wake Forest we get folks from Virginia in our Target and other stores every day. 

Hopefully, soon, the state apps will all work in unison."
4,5,Bea Careful,I don’t think this does anything,2,2020-11-19 19:22:25,"I have to say — I’m a little disappointed. We’ve had the app downloaded on my families phones since it was released and haven’t left the house without masks in months. My husband tested positive earlier this week and we immediately went through the steps of verifying through the app. It’s been three days and neither his, nor mine, says we’ve been exposed. This makes me wonder how many people I passed on our morning walks, picking up groceries, etc. who might have been positive as well."
5,6,SGLPGT,Can’t activate app,5,2020-11-10 13:10:04,"I get an error message when I try to turn notifications on. I had previously installed the VA app, so maybe that’s messing it up? But this app is useless, and I can’t find a way to get help for the issue.— nevermind, had to go find the app settings and change my region."
6,7,ry.sp.wil,So happy we have this,5,2020-09-28 21:45:45,"Better late than never...I hope everyone downloads and uses this app. This is a crucial part of how we will beat the virus, and it’s a great (privacy focused) use of modern technology."
7,8,gryzby,Poor rollout and SLOW process,1,2020-10-08 13:58:02,"Takes 24-48 hours after test result to get a pin to verify a positive test. I’m also saddened by the late rollout and slow adoption for a simple app that Apple provided the framework for. Most people still don’t know about this app, I went through the testing process with Duke and the app was never mentioned, never advertised anywhere. This should be one of the most important tools for mitigating the spread and its being treated like a novelty. Why not StopCovidNC?"
8,9,Miss mookie kitty,Useless,1,2020-11-17 02:42:31,"This app makes it VERY difficult if not impossible to share a positive covid test. You have to have a PIN number and if your doctor has not reported your positive test to health department, no pin will be given to you. Why would anybody lie about a positive covid test. Good lord! So I tried to do the right thing but can’t get a pin so nobody will be notified of my positive test. I would love to know how many people actually get PIN numbers when they call. What a joke."
9,10,jkolling,Get this App PLEASE,5,2020-11-20 17:07:02,We have the technology to help do what humans are terrible at - contact tracing. This app will literally save lives but only if enough people download it.
10,11,Mookanoah,Please share with friends to utilize,4,2020-10-21 21:28:32,"This app is an amazing idea it’s great security wise and just an overall greta concept, BUT it needs to have widespread use. SHARE THE APP THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, TEXT, ECT. It sits away, you never need to get on it. Just download and then fill out the info."
11,12,Dr Fred B,Needs work,1,2020-12-08 04:51:03,I found out over 12 hours agoI have covid. I try to alert thru the app that I have covid but it fails. I called the number which had almost no wait time. Guessing there are not many users. They told me it may take a few days before I can report thru the app. Seems like a complete failure. We wonder why our covid numbers are going up.
12,13,Wwdb.mobile,Notification Issue,3,2021-01-10 03:20:13,The app asks you to enable notifications and takes you to the settings. But on mine notifications are enabled and I cannot progress in the install unless I opt not to receive notifications. IPhone12 ios 14.3.
13,14,Cumberland County resident,To the app developer,5,2020-10-06 23:52:38,Please market this app so that more people know it is available. It benefits all parties involved if more people join.
14,15,cndymunroe,Aggravated,2,2020-12-08 23:18:17,I’ve had this app on my phone for a few months now because I work in retail.  It is very slow in updating during the day. Now it is 6:15pm and the app just said that there was an exposure last checked YESTERDAY at 5:07am. I would like to see quicker checks.
15,16,Trixieisme82,Good idea but need a guide,4,2020-12-02 15:12:52,"It’s a great concept.  But there’s no guide to tell you what things mean.  It says no exposure detected, but twice this week there has been a little red star thing next to that?  What does that mean?"
16,17,Jumping pencil,Works will all state covid apps,5,2020-10-03 11:06:39,"You only need to download one state Covid exposure app, they all communicate to each other.

Pretty nifty!"
17,18,JerryK83,2nd Grade Developer,2,2021-01-09 02:42:38,"This app quality is weak at best. If I took an online course on how to build apps, I could build something better in a week. I certainly hope the government didn’t spend a lot of money on it, but I doubt that’s the case."
18,19,Casey 239331,Heavy battery usage,5,2021-01-03 01:36:11,"For some reason, this app is now draining my battery."
19,20,Baba's Mom,Download this app,5,2020-09-23 00:16:36,No reason not to download and do it for those you love and care about.
20,21,uupistheshit,Amazing!,5,2020-09-24 18:55:52,I love this app!
21,22,normally is a great app,Worthless,1,2020-12-11 22:14:41,"This app does absolutely nothing, as much as I need to be out and as bad as the covid is suppose to be, you would think there would be some kind of notifications. It often doesn’t update for well over a 12 hour period."
22,23,filletbuster,Doesn’t download on IOS 12.4.8?,3,2020-10-23 14:31:36,"Can you fix it so older systems can download it? Otherwise, what’s the point?"
23,24,"a person, not a bunch of bots",Previous versions of iOS,1,2020-09-30 13:48:47,Please consider a patch for phones running older versions of iOS! Not everyone has the newest fanciest technology and it limits this apps reach!
24,25,TV Junkie II,Old Technology,2,2020-10-08 15:44:40,This is a ten year old solution that will have very little impact on stopping COVID-19.   It may have some impact on college campuses but that is about the full extent of its value.
25,26,KrisDragon21,Terrible,1,2020-11-22 17:42:26,We tested positive and have tried multiple times to input and it says it can’t find us.
26,27,melissa_garcia_slays123,GREAT APP ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 5stars,5,2020-09-22 18:39:08,Love this app
