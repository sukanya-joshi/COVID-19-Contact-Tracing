0,1,uofa123,great app,4,2020-09-19 20:59:19,very convenient app for knowing the exposures you have been around but i wish they would not have gotten rid of the exposure details. They should re-add the window where you can see the exposure lengthens as well as the risk level .
1,2,stellarays,Needs Improvement,3,2020-09-03 03:32:37,"I love the concept of this app, but I don‚Äôt think it was ready for release. To begin with, it is very unclear what the risk level ranking is out of (10?), as well as what that actually means. Each time I have been exposed it‚Äôs been ranked as a ‚Äú6‚Äù with no further information. That seems like a high risk level, and yet no suggestions for next steps were made available as promised. Is 6 actually quite low? Friends who have had the same exposure times have much lower risk levels. Why is mine so high? 
Additionally, the notifications are very confusing. I got a notification on Sunday (8/31) that I had had no exposures during the week. Then on Monday night (9/1) I got an alert that I had been exposed... on 8/27 and 8/28. Today I got another notification for an exposure on 8/28. I am wary of these alerts because they all look exactly the same (risk level and time exposed). Are they accurate? Is it a bug? The time exposed seems inaccurate as well. For all three of my ‚Äúexposures‚Äù the times are listed as: ‚Äú0min, 0min, 3min, 0min‚Äù in that exact order. My friends have the same for different supposed exposures on different dates. This app needs more information and more clarity."
2,3,MA fan,Can‚Äôt report; confusing setup,1,2020-12-09 11:08:36,"First of all, I had no idea AZ had this - have never heard a peep about it, and the last time I checked, AZ was not on the list. I discovered it when I was poking around the exposure notification settings on my phone. Without participants, this isn‚Äôt very useful, so AZ should be talking this up every opportunity! Including having the governor mention it in his pressers, as well as other leaders like school superintendents.

Second, setup was confusing. The Settings app says my region (Arizona) has an app and directs me to a list of apps on the App Store, where this one is *not* included. I had to find it by doing a general search, and then it doesn‚Äôt say explicitly in the description that it relies on the Apple/Google system, which I wanted to be sure because otherwise I likely wouldn‚Äôt use it for privacy reasons. I couldn‚Äôt confirm it until I got it installed and saw the integration. Get the app properly listed on the App Store list, and make the Apple connection clear in the app description. 

Finally, I can‚Äôt tell the app that there‚Äôs been a positive diagnosis. Fortunately, I don‚Äôt need to, but without that, the value is significantly reduced. Why is this not included? And who in my area (Phoenix/Scottsdale) can report? Anyone?"
3,4,bgallup,Please bring back the exposure details - Update: I‚Äôm not sure it really works.,2,2020-09-25 15:18:19,"Update: My roommate has tested positive for COVID-19 since my original review. We both have the app downloaded, and being able to look at the possible exposure details was what prompted her to get tested. She reported to the app that she tested positive 3 days ago, but I have yet to receive a possible, much less significant exposure notification. 3 days before her positive result, her and I were sitting probably 4 feet apart watching a movie and both had our phones with us. Just with that much, I should have received a significant exposure notification. I really am questioning if this app works. I‚Äôll leave it on my phone as it doesn‚Äôt take up much space, but I won‚Äôt be relying it on it‚Äôs accuracy. 

Original Review: With this most recent update, they have removed the exposure details for possible exposures, and it‚Äôs very frustrating. Please bring this back."
4,5,WILMAWILDCAT,Unknown,3,2020-09-19 16:05:57,"Can‚Äôt tell anything once you get notified. It‚Äôs gives you a fake phone number to call to get a test. I am getting notifications alerts but when I go to app it shows nothing... two days in a row. This app is frustrating.

I have over 10 exposures and would like to know why I keep getting exposed when I talk to no one? Is it from Driving around?"
5,6,Skyscan305,A huge failure when it was needed most,1,2020-12-11 01:08:57,"I have had this app on my phone for months, and fully believe in contact tracing.  However, between not enough people using the app for it to matter, and the app failing when needed most (I was attempting to input a positive test that I just received), this app is useless.  I work as a first responder, and I have seen what happens when infrastructure falls apart like this poorly-maintained app.  I will be sharing my opinions with the Arizona Department of Health Services."
6,7,UsedatUA,"Great concept, but still some bugs to work out",3,2020-10-03 05:10:08,"I love it, and am so thankful for the app. Still seems like there are some bugs to flush out. I get a fair amount of push notifications for possible exposures without any significant exposures or possible exposures listed in the app itself. It would also be helpful to know the physical distances used for attenuation risk."
7,8,dib and dip,Needs to be updated,3,2020-09-17 07:00:17,"This app is great for discovering if you‚Äôve been exposed and when. However, it does not explain the risk level number they give you, which is incredibly confusing. I would like to know if that number is referring to time interval of exposure, distance, or level out of 10 or 20 or whatever."
8,9,Jon Silvestri,New update weird,3,2020-09-22 10:05:21,"I can‚Äôt see the details of exposures anymore after the new update. Also it‚Äôs super unclear what the exposure levels mean. Like a 6 seems high, but is that out of 10? 20? 100?"
9,10,MJV92314,Appreciate the Anonymity!,5,2020-08-20 16:22:06,I‚Äôm glad there is an app that does exposure notification that is anonymous! I work at UArizona and am happy that this app is available to us. Intuitive to use and easy to navigate.
10,11,AuntJess,Help your community,5,2020-08-21 11:46:56,This app can help slow coronavirus in our communities. I hope many people download! It‚Äôs so easy to set up and there are no privacy concerns - it‚Äôs safe and secure.
11,12,JennaRut,"Simple, private and safe",5,2020-08-20 00:43:49,So easy to install and knowing it is working in the background to help keep me informed of unknown exposures is brilliant. All while keeping my identity unknown is very innovative. Well done.
12,13,Hot Toasted Buns!,Our lives are in the line!!!,1,2021-01-08 23:57:06,"What‚Äôs wrong with AZ? Why can‚Äôt they move the importance of a working app up the prioritization list in a timely manner? 
If it‚Äôs well past the time that the whole state has a working app! An app where we can not only receive notifications but also REPORT positive results without all the GobbleDeGook official codes etc.."
13,14,Manuelcarl,I feel safe,5,2020-08-21 05:24:16,This app is very well designed and stable! I feel safe knowing this will be an extra layer of our health! Bear down
14,15,Goofytina,Doesn‚Äôt work,1,2020-09-25 18:56:45,If I could give it negative stars I would. My daughter is at the university of Arizona gets notified multiple times while getting food she has been in contact. Stating she was in contact for 20mins. She has no in person classes and is stuck in her dorm all day. She is on our third mandatory covid test by university. All negative
15,16,jco223,Grateful for this,5,2020-08-21 01:27:04,The interface of the app explains how it works clearly. So glad it is privacy focused and a nonprofit is behind it. Thank you!
16,17,matt1o.jh,Ios 12.5 compatibility,5,2020-12-14 22:06:14,Plz update this app to support ios 12.5 üòÅ
17,18,Medreeze,Pointless,1,2020-12-18 19:40:29,"Great concept in theory, but that‚Äôs about it. 

First, what good is using the phones of the population, if said population doesn‚Äôt have the app?

Secondly, and way more damning... I had felt symptoms a full ten days ago, and received my positive test eight days ago. How is the app supposed to work if I can‚Äôt log a positive result?

My wife contracted covid from a work colleague (neither of whom have any idea what this app is) and i contracted covid from my wife. Yet the app has not the slightest clue i‚Äôm sick. 

Deleting this pointless app."
18,19,jexxica21,Useless,1,2020-12-18 17:43:12,"This app is useless; I have been trying for 10 days to report the positive diagnosis in my household and it does not allow me to update my diagnosis to show that I, and everyone in my household, is positive."
19,20,Cezannechavez,Positive.,1,2020-11-24 22:04:01,"I tested positive but there is no way of informing the app.
Be aware folks that this app isn‚Äôt accurate. 
If I can‚Äôt update the app that I‚Äôm positive there are likely many others. 
Needs an update ASAP."
20,21,jcextreme88,"Not quite useful, yet",2,2021-01-11 19:57:04,"This app needs to be released to the public, it‚Äôs been months since it‚Äôs original release but limiting to UArizona and NAU render it useless."
21,22,Tony_AZ,Used 40% of my battery very quickly,1,2020-09-23 01:11:23,"I want to do this.  I want this app to work.  But wow, the battery drain is UNREAL.  Fix it and I will use again."
22,23,frustrated._.,Bug,1,2020-09-18 17:38:50,"Ever since the update a day ago, I can‚Äôt view the details about my possible exposures. I have no idea what level they are or how long I was exposed. THE APP ISNT WORKING SINCE THE UPDATE"
23,24,Koppo180,Useless,1,2020-12-17 01:04:55,I literally work in a hospital with confirmed Covid-19 patients and go in their rooms everyday I work. The app has never told me I had a possible exposure. Good job AZ!
