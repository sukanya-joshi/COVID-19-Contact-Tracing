0,1,Evereddie60,"Good app, wealth of info, one flaw",4,2020-12-27 16:06:56,"This is an excellent app overall. Data breakdowns and trends. The only flaw is that it appears the only users are the ones taking this seriously and be cautious. The ‚Äúhow are you feeling today‚Äù rates have never changed % wise where actual state numbers in the app vary. Still a good app, shame not everyone uses it. It could be amazingly helpful."
1,2,Dave954,"Horrible, horrible, AWFUL app!",1,2020-09-23 15:42:47,"When I opened the app initially, it was fine. It had a nice look and it was requesting information as I would expect any app to do. Then, my phone started getting incredibly hot, like too hot to handle comfortably and I have a silicone case!

Okay, so I set the phone down and continued to use the app because, I figured, what could possibly go wrong when a phone gets 160 degrees, right? Before I finished registering, the app would keep crashing. I tried this several times until the app actually crashed other apps that I had open! I haven‚Äôt seen this happen many times before but I went ahead because, hey, maybe it‚Äôs just a bad first impression and I should give it at least 15 chances to not fail, right? Onward!

Finally, I registered the application, poked around a bit, my phone still feeling like I imagine a tin roof would feel in Calcutta in the middle of July and exited. This started the long-awaited cooldown period for my phone. Take a breath!

Later this morning, I come back to it and open the app only to find that I have to *re*register. The login that I had created wouldn‚Äôt work to get back in and I spent maybe a little less time registering the second time (it always takes longer the first time, doesn‚Äôt it?)... aaaaaand my phone‚Äôs burning my hands again.

Alright, well... this is where I am with this. I‚Äôll give you more feedback later!"
2,3,MonikaLearnsJapanese,Better late than never,5,2020-09-22 23:08:42,"First day of fall, so, timely. New app - little to report. Easy and fast to install. Easy to use and nice statistics. I trust Apple enough to not worry about tracking more than I already do. I hope that if I do accidentally catch Covid, that this will help alert some of the few strangers I might have been near to and help them to avoid further spread."
3,4,Binford46,Bluetooth tracking is key,5,2020-09-23 10:19:45,"This app, unlike others, uses your Bluetooth sensors to determine if a contact happened vs tracking your location. It's a variant on apps deployed elsewhere around the world, doesn't store where you've been, and can track symptoms and share vital statistics so that all Pennaylvanians can navigate the pandemic a bit better."
4,5,RLEash,Drains my phone‚Äôs battery,2,2020-09-28 11:03:13,"I was really looking forward to this app but after having it for only a few days I had to delete it.  It drained my phone battery way too fast.  Even while I‚Äôm sleeping at night my battery dropped from 100% charge to 60%.  Normally I only lose 5% or so.  My phone says the draining culprit isn‚Äôt the PA Covid app itself but Apple‚Äôs built-in ‚Äúexposure notification‚Äù setting that this app utilizes and needs enabled.  

If it weren‚Äôt for that, I would have really liked this app!"
5,6,Christina Check,Excited for this app!,5,2020-09-23 01:47:56,"So far, so good. Love that there is an Exposure Alert. I think this is going to be very helpful especially in the upcoming winter months and beyond. Kudus to the developers as I‚Äôm sure this app was extremely time consuming to create straight through to beta testing, with likely many iterations along the way to make it user friendly."
6,7,Anahata108,Needs some bugs fixed,4,2020-10-22 13:02:13,"Seems to do what it says but I‚Äôve not gotten any notifications of exposure so ü§∑. I do wish it would stop asking me if I want to participate every few days. Sometimes I respond to the daily check in notification and need to say that yes, I do want the thing I configured my phone for. Please stop asking me every few days."
7,8,michael_recinos,Really???!,1,2020-11-25 21:37:44,This app seems like a really useful app and I feel very safe with it and hopefully it does a good job but there is just one striking issue with this app that I don‚Äôt get at all. When you go to choose your race on the app (which firstly I don‚Äôt get why that has to be a thing but okay) it has all the other races but it seemingly excludes the Hispanic race (which I am) from the entire list which is really weird to me how someone might forget that but alright. It‚Äôs just one obvious issue I see so far that really should not be an issue
8,9,iPhone 3G old user,"Needs features of NOVID, but at least it is functional.",4,2020-09-23 18:52:03,"This app will run in the background, but not give you an estimate of how many levels exist between you and someone who tested positive for COVID.

NOVID has better features, but will not run in the background yet.

It is important for greater effectiveness that more people voluntarily use COVID Alert Pennsylvania."
9,10,rffggyy,Daily check in issue,4,2020-09-23 03:33:13,I‚Äôve been having an issue at the daily check in tab. I was only got to check in when I first downloaded the app and when I go to check in for the following days it just says ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù as if I already checked in for the day.
10,11,XnCelt,I like the app so far...Apple Watch,4,2020-11-20 12:16:24,I am impressed with the features and quality of the iPhone app. My Apple Watch un-tethers me from my iPhone so I lose the alert feature of the PA COVID-19 app when I leave my phone at home?  I hope you are working on Apple Watch support with your app. Thank you.
11,12,Awesomepsu22,Does exactly what it‚Äôs supposed to and is easy to use.,5,2020-09-23 02:04:37,"I mean really that‚Äôs it. Was this needed much sooner? Absolutely. But it‚Äôs here and it exceeded my expectations by meeting what they should have been. It‚Äôs easy to use, runs well, and the UI is smooth and intuitive."
12,13,JJERC,App does not work with older iPhone versions,1,2021-01-06 00:02:19,"If your going to ask the public to help out and participate in contact tracing then provide an app that will work with earlier versions of IOS software.  Not everyone has a fancy new IPhone and especially in these times when people can‚Äôt pay rent and afford groceries, how can they afford to upgrade to a new phone... The people in charge (Levine and Wolf) should be aware of this and push to get it fixed!"
13,14,flushthedon,Didn‚Äôt ask any info from me!,5,2020-09-26 00:49:18,No battery drain for me at all. I use Bluetooth all the time. I‚Äôm glad this doesn‚Äôt track location. I‚Äôm downloading to be part of a solution in this pandemic. You should too!
14,15,CelloFingers,Easy,5,2020-12-12 19:55:03,"Easy to use, pops up with a reminder same time every day. No hassle, helps in a big way.

Do I need to leave the app open in the background for the Bluetooth contact alerts?"
15,16,Mac Thaker,The right thing to do!,5,2020-09-24 20:55:24,"App is simple and easy to use. Doing the job it promised. If you are 2nd guessing about privacy, this is more secured than any app out there. So stop guessing and download the app NOW. Put your phone to the fight against COVID19."
16,17,Spauldog,Other states have more helpful Covid apps,3,2020-10-15 13:54:18,"I like the checkin and ability to drill into data for individual counties. 
More work is needed‚Äîapp shows notifications are off when they are on for the App. 
Not enough detail regarding active cases. 
Cannot expand the graphs, so they are small on a phone and not as useful as they could be."
17,18,mruffalo,"Delay or not, works well",5,2020-09-23 01:24:00,"I don't expect the PA Department of Health to have in-house iOS app development expertise, and I don't mind some delay in vetting a customized third party app. PA is still among the first states to enable this kind of contact tracing, at least according to the App Store, and I'm happy to participate."
18,19,Shakir o,Clearly presented.,5,2020-09-23 00:18:19,"App has up to date stats in current cases, hospitalization and deaths. Easily connects with exposure notifications and doesn‚Äôt require an account. Glad that we can leverage the APIs and hope more people continue to adopt it."
19,20,BrushXue,Why is it taking so long to develop such a simple App?,3,2020-09-21 20:13:53,It‚Äôs been 6 months since the pandemic outbreak and finally the tracking app is available. Apple developed the API and this app is just a simple shell so I couldn‚Äôt understand what is holding up the development? You should know that more lives can be saved if you publish it earlier.
20,21,mayzin1,I like the concept and the service,4,2020-11-18 16:02:05,"But I think there is something wrong with the Statistics that are displayed for each county. I‚Äôm reading in other sources that the percentages in most counties in PA are almost 10%, and yet the app shows about 50 counties in PA at 1% or less."
21,22,LaraThomas,"Clear, understandable",4,2020-09-23 18:46:59,"I‚Äôd like to see it be able to tell me more specifics but understand that will probably take time to collect the data. So far, I like it. Clean, clear design with lots of info on privacy"
22,23,BBFWBCT,"Easy, useful, and beneficial to the community",5,2020-12-27 17:19:00,"The more people we get using this, the sooner we can get things under control and go back to normal."
23,24,mforinger,Alert ?,3,2020-10-16 22:55:54,My phone had two notifications.  I have no idea if it was for this app. Nothing showed on my phone. And it doesn‚Äôt have any history of any alerts. I only assume the tone was for this app because it‚Äôs the only app I‚Äôve added.
24,25,Carlosh954,It‚Äôs a good start,4,2020-10-19 00:15:29,"This is actually helpful in the fight of COVID , use it be honest when checking in, and please don‚Äôt be that guy that think this is a hoax believe me I‚Äôve seen COVID front and center and it‚Äôs no joke"
25,26,Zippo517,Up and running,5,2020-09-23 14:30:44,The app loads quickly and looks nice doesn‚Äôt seem to take up much battery life.
26,27,johnnydangr,Works perfectly,5,2020-09-23 01:13:41,Exactly what I expected. Focus on privacy so you can provide as much info as you like about yourself. Thanks for developing this.
27,28,jSiu,Yay. Finally.,5,2020-09-22 22:16:12,Been waiting for PA to release their exposure app. There are firms charging $10/mon per user for exposure and contact tracing. So glad that our local government is stepping in to democratize this. Thank you.
28,29,Croutonzz,Waste,1,2020-12-25 13:02:56,"Nobody uses it, you have to be 18 which eliminates a major portion of the population that is also susceptible to carrying/transmitting the virus, and it‚Äôs just a major waste of space at this point. If people actually used it maybe it would make sense, but until it‚Äôs widely supported you‚Äôre just offering free private info about yourself to the government."
29,30,SatoriBerner,Great idea,5,2020-10-01 23:20:52,This is a great idea for an app. I suppose whether or not it does well directly depends on how many people use it..... so download it!!! :D
30,31,wf013,county selection,3,2020-12-02 20:06:08,it would be nice of you could 'permanently' select a county instead of having to do it every time you want to see your local county.  lots of scrolling to get to Susquehanna county
31,32,Marmarz,Just started using the app,5,2020-09-23 15:44:31,I wish Apple would make it for my iwatch
32,33,MattAaron,Everyone should install this,5,2020-09-22 20:16:03,Automated contact tracing could save lives
33,34,peachtree43,Great concept,5,2020-09-23 15:20:32,Excited to see this app launch. Participation will give granular data to aid policymakers and accelerate the return to a more normal life in this state.
34,35,illmaticone,Only works if we all use honestly,5,2020-09-22 16:33:52,Please go download and use this as suggested.
35,36,Gregcheersykes,Great,5,2020-09-23 05:08:56,"Finally this app is out and it uses the Apple API!  Great!  Now we just need widespread use!  It‚Äôs a pretty good app for coming from the PA Government, so kudos!!"
36,37,Mary Beth Z,Think I received exposure alert but it disappeared!! Can someone assist? How can I verify? Thanks,3,2020-11-05 16:28:23,I think I received an exposure alert but it disappeared. Please let me know how I can verify
37,38,409Joe,Wolf in Sheep‚Äôs Clothing,1,2020-09-23 13:20:23,This app shouldn‚Äôt even exist. It does however provide data proving that the curve was flattened long ago.  Nice job. However I‚Äôve had the app installed for a day and it drains my battery from nearly 100% to single digits in less than an hour.
38,39,Bj in kid min,Check the math,3,2020-12-03 17:05:07,The numbers for increases in cases and deaths are not accurate. Appears to be a math error or an issue with the data
39,40,B2bhawaii,Alert?,1,2020-12-21 16:20:46,Can someone actually post a photo of what the alert will look like? I‚Äôve gotten alerts from this app before and they disappear right away. I have no idea if it was an exposure alert or not.
40,41,Ken Geist,Easy and simple!,5,2020-09-23 01:42:09,"Great app, simple to use! Puts my mind at ease"
41,42,DoeWDW,Easy,5,2020-09-22 23:13:36,Easy to set up and easy to use
42,43,Obywann,Nice app,5,2020-09-23 00:15:12,Happy our state finally released an official app.  Love you Wolf and Levine
43,44,Pongo5295,BATTERY ALERT!,1,2020-09-23 03:26:33,"I just want to report SEVERE BATTERY DEPLETION! The app was only on my device for a matter of minutes when I saw my battery go from 94% to 86% in about 30 seconds! It never has done that before. 

I deleted the app."
44,45,Stating the facts,Thankful for this app,5,2020-09-23 02:55:43,Thankful for this app!
45,46,reopen pa,Waste of time,1,2020-09-23 12:43:29,Do you have this available for the nursing homes you locked down as well?
46,47,Voobu,Not helpful,1,2020-09-26 00:33:35,"If a real pandemic comes along one day, they‚Äôll have the ‚Äúgroundwork‚Äù laid out to track sick people.  A lot of wasted time and money for a treatable virus."
47,48,Crack addict.,Horrible,1,2020-09-23 00:53:41,After downloading app my battery life was down a 1/4 and the orange light indicating my microphone was being used kept turning on.
48,49,mdof4,Sad,1,2020-11-18 14:22:53,Can‚Äôt use on iphones that you can‚Äôt use 13 plus software on.
49,50,ShanLip,Drains battery horribly!,1,2020-09-27 22:16:00,Had no battery issues till I downloaded this app!  Complete BS.
50,51,"Cosmo Kramer, MD",Avoid and all Costs,1,2020-09-24 18:15:44,Kills your battery and provides no value (like Wolf).
51,52,ffs what name isnt taken,Meh,2,2020-09-23 15:49:27,Consistent error 1002 when attempting to set up.
52,53,jbloom81,Do not download,1,2020-09-23 20:07:11,This app is terrible. Does nothing for you. Just another wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing! Beware!!!
53,54,WickedVisage,I can't use this.,1,2020-12-16 09:36:05,IPhone 6. I can't use this. IOS 12.5.
54,55,markm531,App not Accurate,1,2020-12-26 01:19:15,This app is not accurate at all.
55,56,Jon shanahan,Wear a mask,5,2020-09-22 13:42:27,Stop the spread
56,57,Jessicamana,No Thanks,1,2020-09-23 03:33:14,This is late. This is stupid. This is a waste of time.
57,58,Wifey_14,Only for Pennsylvania,1,2020-12-09 02:30:43,Is this app strictly for PENNSYLVANIA?
58,59,riganati,False Negative Exposure,1,2021-01-08 20:19:09,Never received an alert. Got COVID. Never received 6 digit code from Health Dept. after testing positive. No way to notify others of COVID exposure anonymously or otherwise. App is less than useless without this missing link. Can lead you to believe you haven‚Äôt been exposed when you might have been.
59,60,HopMatt,Doesn‚Äôt work,1,2021-01-06 02:22:18,"I‚Äôve received 0 exposure notifications living in one of the biggest COVID hotspots in the nation and having been near people who tested positive.

EDIT: These people are using the app and have entered their code from the DoH. 

This app does not work."
60,61,BPI1356,Why at state level?,5,2020-09-28 18:06:37,This app has limited impact.  It should be used on a national level.  There‚Äôs also no advertisements on this?  It should be pushed through YouTube ads.  I found it only by searching on App Store.
61,62,Carldarunner,No alert code,1,2021-01-05 13:31:28,"Tested positive, but received no code. Therefore this app, due to an apparent lack of foresight and planning, is worse than useless. It makes people think that they could be notified of an exposure when in fact this is not happening."
62,63,Hells Critic,Tested Positive,1,2020-12-11 00:13:02,I tested positive for Covid and no one gave me a code for the app like they are to. The state is not the using the app as it says. Cause I know others who have tested positive and no one contacted them either. Really this app is so bad it should not even have one star.
63,64,Arctic187,Could be useful but isn‚Äôt,1,2020-11-26 03:42:09,"Knew I had likely had covid 6 days ago, have a positive test now. There is no way to report a positive test without DOH giving you a special code which you will never receive because they are too busy. It‚Äôs a waste of time, don‚Äôt bother."
64,65,9908&tuther,Great idea.  Doesn‚Äôt work.,2,2020-11-15 18:22:40,"I have COVID.

  I got a test as soon as I could after symptoms began. As soon as I got results, I contacted the number provided on the app to get a 6 digit code to enter so my casual contacts could be notified.  That was on Thursday.  It‚Äôs now Sunday.  No code.  I‚Äôve called 3 times.  So it‚Äôs now been likely 1.5 weeks since I was infected and no one has been notified by the app.  

RIDICULOUS.  

(And I notified everyone I know; this was for more casual encounters)."
65,66,kgs33981,Error Code 1003,1,2020-11-12 18:28:00,I keep getting an error code when I click to get started. I deleted it and tried again but the error keeps happening.
66,67,bdtufdthgf,Don‚Äôt waste your time,1,2020-10-27 17:31:53,Can‚Äôt tell app you have tested positive for COVID. 4 days and counting and still no activation code.
67,68,KK_DA_CATüò∫,Useless if the health dept isn‚Äôt contact tracing,1,2021-01-11 16:17:33,"This app seems like a great idea. However, it requires users to input a code given to them by their local health dept. Four members of my family tested positive recently. Only 1 of the 4 received a call from the health dept., and nobody received a code for the app. As a result, none of my family‚Äôs info is included in this app‚Äôs supposed tracing. And, the fifth person in my family has received no alerts telling them that they were exposed to Covid, even though they clearly were. Totally useless and deleting the app today."
