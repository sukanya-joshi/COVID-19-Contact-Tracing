0,1,Umbrella Alley,Hope it works?,4,2020-11-12 17:53:46,Just downloaded three days ago I‚Äôve traveled and run a lot of errands clocked in at least 25 mile radius nothing coming up so far. Not much as far as information or user maneuverability goes.
1,2,Ghostbuster1248,HELPS EVERYONE,5,2020-12-14 19:58:08,"Easy to install.  It depends on people to use the app, and to self-report when they know they have been exposed or if they test positive.  It‚Äôs anonymous.  All the system does is alert others who were close to an exposed person.  It uses the short-range (30 feet) Bluetooth radio in your smartphone, NOT GPS information.  Again, it‚Äôs completely anonymous for those who self-report and to anyone who is later alerted.    All of us who use the app provide a benefit to our communities, and to ourselves, as well.  It‚Äôs not a perfect system.  If it betters your chances (or a loved one) by 15%, would you use it?   5%?   You betcha."
2,3,DebbieLim,app does NOT detect Covid,3,2020-11-13 12:49:59,"Hey... This App does NOT detect Covid. The only way you will see ANY notice is IF the person uses this app to warn us. I cannot give it any ‚Äústar ratings‚Äù because I see nothing or notice any changes in the App. I have it a neutral rating so that I could post my review. 
Battery drainage?  I see zero drainage on my cell. Make sure to check your Battery in your Settings and see where most of the drainage is coming from. 
Remember, this is a brand new App and most do not know about it. Let‚Äôs just hope most will use it. 
As for the city offices that spread Covid, noticing that this app was out there for one day or so at that time, they probably did not know about this app yet?  Hopefully it was on the news or in the media to warn people? 
I am trying to stay positive here. The BEST way to stay safe is to WEAR A MASK!  Now that is one thing I can complain about. When I am out at the park or driving by a little league game, 99.9% of the people were NOT wearing a mask!  That is a shame!
Stay safe everyone. We need to stick together and do what is right, because we ALL are going through this."
3,4,Kmamasan,Useless,5,2020-11-13 22:20:12,"I like the idea . But the fact that this app relies completely on self reporting and given the delays in reporting test results, this fall far short of being an effective tool. By the time you actually get your test result, if you‚Äôre one of the VERY FEW people that have downloaded this app , the effectiveness goes out the window . This app will not track your movements from 3 or 4 or more days ago to tell you that you were in close contact with someone who finally got their result and then decided to go ahead and report through this app."
4,5,yottalogical,Protects Your Privacy!,5,2020-10-20 00:59:34,"The way these contact tracing apps work is actually quite interesting. Somewhat counterintuitively, its able to do its job effectively without violating your privacy.

It doesn't track your location, it doesn't know your name or anything about you, it doesn't know the identities of the people you've come into contact with, and it doesn't spread any information about who you are to others.

Very awesome to know that we can keep ourselves safe during a public health crisis without having to give up our privacy."
5,6,Zee_alh,Really good!,5,2020-12-03 04:54:21,"I really like this app! I find it to be very useful and informational. It helps us stay alert and well aware of everything. I feel like this app has potential to help decrease the spread of COVID-19 in Michigan. This app will allow our community to stay safe. I recommend this app to everyone. The whole idea of posting your results is a really smart thing. However, even though the results will most definitely be off by a couple days, results are results and it‚Äôll help all of us stay safe."
6,7,Ryan from MI,How it works 101,5,2020-11-13 16:29:21,"Basically 2 phones have to have the app installed. If one persons tests positive AND reports it in the app AND your phone was within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes, then your app would provide you a notification.

If the person who tests positive DOES NOT share the results in their app, your app would NOT provide you a notification.

Be courteous to others and report positive test results in the app."
7,8,remidy rhyiems,Better safe than sorry,5,2020-12-09 07:20:43,It‚Äôs better to be educated about the Situation then not to be I don‚Äôt have any more room on my phone but I love this app I‚Äôm gonna have to get a memory card so that I can get this app I downloaded it but I can only use it for a day because there was Not enoughSpace to keep it on my phone but I definitely would‚Äôve kept it
8,9,Alainahd,Does not alert,2,2020-12-08 21:47:07,"I ended up getting covid and only place I can think of is between 3 places... mainly a grocery store near me.... I went to self report however I did not have a ‚ÄúPIN‚Äù from the local health department. I was in the hospital when I found out about being positive. It would be nice to be able to report being positive. I called all 3 places myself and told them I tested positive so the employees are aware of exposure. I did NOT have symptoms. However now I have a stuffy nose that comes and goes, can‚Äôt smell, and hardly can taste."
9,10,Myhomesweethome,Good app,5,2020-11-10 16:55:27,I like the idea and functionality of this app however I wonder if this will be as affective as this was meant to be unless as many people as possible can download and use it.I kind of feel like those who don‚Äôt care too much about Covid probably it wouldn‚Äôt care to download this app anyway.
10,11,Gypsy growls,Doesn‚Äôt do the job intended - failed for me,1,2020-10-22 12:45:23,"I was at the Clinton Township mi clerks office on 10-21, stood in line went to several desks talked to three people at clerks office. The one who handed my ballot to me didn‚Äôt have a mask on. 
I get home later that day turn on evening news to find that right after I left, it was discovered the clerk and other people who work there had Covid and didn‚Äôt report it. The office was shut down right around an hour after I left and is closed for next 5 days...during an election...and I was exposed having been there.

I waited for this app to alert me, I mean it was on the news! It‚Äôs reported! I was there for hours! 
They closed the township offices due to it!

But this morning I looked...app still says ‚Äúno exposures‚Äù.  It is unreliable and just failed the most simple test.  Who put this thing out? 

Grade: total fail"
11,12,villfe,Villey,5,2020-12-18 19:28:45,In response to the review of ‚Äúuseless‚Äù this app is better than nothing.  Maybe if enough of us sign up it will change the thinking and would become very effective tool.  Let give it a try and encourage other to do the same.
12,13,travel with pets,Trace and stop the spread of covid,5,2020-11-13 18:43:57,Glad to see this is available. I think there needs to be an increased campaign so everyone is aware and will make it more effective. Everyone living and traveling in Michigan should have this app activated to help with the test and trace and eventually the elimination of covid!!
13,14,araquimi,Needed it,5,2020-10-21 17:27:08,Its been a long since other states have released similar apps. I have been waiting for this app because it could help notify people who have been in close contact with someone testing positive such as in the grocery store.
14,15,Decreet,The app is awesome!,5,2020-10-18 14:54:07,I‚Äôm so happy that this app exists during this time right now. It shows if you have been exposed in the location and time. It is just really helpful. Please download it! It could save lives!
15,16,Max pandas,Why does race matter?,3,2021-01-10 04:20:09,"If you go to the stats tab you can select a ‚Äúdemographic layer‚Äù.  It allows you to select black, hispanic, and native American. You can‚Äôt select any other race; the only other option is Non-White.  What does this mean, is the app racist? We‚Äôre all human and want to know how many of us have corona"
16,17,schndlbck,üôåüèº,5,2020-11-18 08:25:33,"It‚Äôs so nice that our state finally catches on to creating an app for exposure notifications! Honestly, only nitpick would be to say that, maybe a lil more work could have gone into the app icon. üòú"
17,18,MoRon9000,Some ignorant reviews here.,5,2020-11-11 18:25:17,"The app doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúdetect covid‚Äù, it only works if the confirmed case person has this installed and also reports it using a discrete PIN you get with your positive result."
18,19,xXUrMakerXx,Perfect excuse to get out of work,1,2020-11-16 14:46:17,"It‚Äôs the perfect excuse to get out of work for a long period of time. With the health department telling you quarantine for 5 days before even getting tested and then recommend the long wait COVID test. Bam! You have 10 days off of work. This all done regardless of having any symptoms at all, even after waiting 5 days before getting tested. Good job at failing."
19,20,Masjed Reviewer,Absolutely Useless,1,2020-12-22 21:24:15,"I have gotten NO alerts about COVID  cases in my community, even though friends. next- door neighbors AND my spouse have all tested positive at various times in the last few weeks,  and in some cases were hospitalized, and all these cases were reported. Why offer this app if there is no accurate/ consistent reporting happening?"
20,21,Jaydog OHara,Better than a Vaccine!,5,2020-11-13 15:18:34,No need for a vaccine when you have this app downloaded to your phone!
21,22,Airport guy mi,Great app,5,2020-11-12 20:35:50,I hope everyone uses this.  The more the better we all will be
22,23,C_Eags,Idea Good.  Functionality Makes It Useless.,1,2020-11-16 00:50:43,We tried to be good citizens and download the app.  When you go to report a Covid case it requires a PIN number only given out by the Heath department.  So anyone diagnosed by any other location has no way of repeating their case on this app.  Stupid and makes this app completely inaccurate and useless.
23,24,Asclepias19,Falls short,1,2020-11-28 13:31:46,"Good idea but completely useless.
I was near someone who tested positive last week.  Took 3 days for that person to get a pin from the MDH to enter his positive result in the app.  Since then, it‚Äôs been 5 days and still my app says ‚Äúno exposures‚Äù
If I didn‚Äôt know that the person tested positive, I could be spreading covid all around.  What a joke!"
24,25,ssr14,Easy turn on Bluetooth,5,2020-11-22 03:01:35,"1) Install
2)Leave Bluetooth on
    When leaving house
3) Forget until needed 
  a) notify if you get sick
  b) get tested if you get notified"
25,26,RnJoe69,I‚Äôm hoping,3,2020-11-22 16:34:07,"I‚Äôm hoping this app works better than the few reviews that I‚Äôve read!  Anything on the positive side has to be better than what Trump is doing right now, which is NOTHING"
26,27,as1nc,Not practical,1,2020-12-23 13:22:30,I got covid a month ago and went to report it using the app.  Never once was a pin referenced in the process nor was I ever contacted by anyone attempting to provide one.  If people have to go out of their way to try to figure this out good luck getting anyone to use this tool.
27,28,PeterDouche,I don‚Äôt have Covid yet but my phone is blowing up,2,2020-11-27 05:16:54,Wish I hadn‚Äôt signed up because now the state has my private information and I‚Äôm pretty sure they sold it because I‚Äôm getting telemarketers calling me all the sudden
28,29,Evieangel33,Tracking,2,2020-11-16 13:46:30,With thousand of cases and not 1 notification.  I deleted the app because it depends on individuals testing positive to share results and not 1 result has shown on my app since I signed up . Great idea but can t depend on the public in my opinion
29,30,Wazafceast1,Doesn‚Äôt work.,1,2021-01-06 03:25:33,I ended up getting COVID and was still never exposed on this app. I have tried numerous times to notify others on app but it would never allow me to. I had to be contacted by the health department which they never called. So this is a very useless app
30,31,DdJjWw335,Needs work,2,2020-12-22 04:11:55,I never received a PIN number after testing positive so I basically can‚Äôt use the app. I wish there was another way to track it.
31,32,H8losing2u,Defeats Its Purpose,2,2020-12-16 18:25:20,"I was recently tested positive for COVID-19. When the Health Department called me. I asked for the PIN that is required to share positive exposure, and they knew nothing about giving a PIN number. Makes the app useless. Very disappointed."
32,33,Immedius,Good but not perfect,3,2020-11-14 19:13:37,"It‚Äôs well designed with the glaring oversight of needing iOS 13.7+, so the highest risk people in my family can‚Äôt use it on their older phones."
33,34,mPINK94,If I could do negative I would!,1,2020-12-02 02:56:33,"How come when I open the app to check the stats, ‚Äúthe statewide racial breakdown of the cases and deaths‚Äù it‚Äôs only African Americans, Hispanic/Latino & Native Americans! WHERE ARE THE OTHER ETHNICITIES??? Why are y‚Äôall just disclosing them? Other races could be carrying them not just the minorities! TRASH!"
34,35,Erich DOG,Zero Stars if possible!!!,1,2020-12-06 23:20:46,"Had a positive PCR result and never a call from health officials to give a pin to enter. Makes me speculate that I had close contact and they never could update app. 
Another failure in this country over the pandemic!"
35,36,James.albrightii,Waste,1,2020-12-08 20:09:50,We could have used the same money to help us track missing persons or child abductions. There are built-in efforts already installed on iPhones. Whoever wasted this money should be fired and fined.
36,37,ElMEFR,Did not notify me,1,2021-01-10 13:15:42,I am about to delete this app. Don‚Äôt work. On two different occasions I had coworkers that had Covid. This app never told me that I had been in close contact with them.
37,38,thickarm,Useless,1,2020-12-12 00:38:49,"Can‚Äôt report that I got COVID because it requires a pin/code that nobody gives you to enter.  Never received any alerts, probably because nobody is able to report anything."
38,39,Myrt72,App does not work,1,2020-11-11 14:20:48,Don‚Äôt waste your time. It doesn‚Äôt work the way it was designed. I keep filling in the prompts for region and other prompts only to find that it did not fill and will not work.
39,40,dualtronic,Battery drain,2,2021-01-04 14:55:27,Uses 25% of battery each charge. BLE is not so low energy.
40,41,MCotton24,No 8 digit pin,3,2020-11-15 18:49:27,I tested positive for COVID and I never got an 8 digit pin. So how was I supposed to notify others?
41,42,12fpi23,Garbage and doesn‚Äôt work,1,2020-11-05 20:27:54,I got covid and no warning from this app. Couldn‚Äôt get more ironic than that. Thanks for nothing.
42,43,worthlessappinmichigan,Absolutely worthless app,1,2020-11-18 23:51:34,"This app is not worth the time it takes to load it. Not only does it not provide any useful information, IT DOES NOT PROVIDE TIMELY OR ACCURATE COVID REPORTS IN WEST MICHIGAN! THE LOCAL NEWS OUTLETS PROVIDE ACCURATE COVID REPORTS WHILE THIS APP PROVIDES NO INFORMATION EXCEPT THE GOVERNOR‚ÄôS CLOSURE ORDERS."
43,44,Babsrle,Drains Battery,2,2020-10-28 19:32:32,"I really like the idea of this app, but it absolutely DESTROYS my battery."
44,45,Arnoldb7,Useless,1,2020-12-12 01:26:42,I tested positive. Never got a PIN. I cannot report in the app. Isn‚Äôt this the reason for downloading this app?
45,46,dk32,Significant Battery Drain,1,2020-11-17 23:57:12,Thought it was working as expected but I noticed significant battery drain (21%) on my iPhone X.
46,47,It-boy-Roy,Needs work,2,2020-12-01 15:27:01,"I truly like the concept of this app. However it‚Äôs not functioning properlyOn iOS 14.2. Every day when I wake up I have a notification from his app telling me Bluetooth is turned off when in fact my Bluetooth is turned on. I don‚Äôt turn Bluetooth off. something is messed up in your code.  
Also I‚Äôve been around people who have Covid and I did not get an alert. So there‚Äôs that."
47,48,floridaStyles,Does not accept positive PIN number,1,2020-11-17 02:43:47,Tested positive. App does not accept pin code from positive result. Need to do some better QA over there. Sorry for now this app is a one star.
48,49,lukkymeee,Doesn‚Äôt work,1,2021-01-12 03:31:27,"EDIT: No way to contact app support for further follow up. 
 Pretty sure this app doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm essential and am everywhere all day long and that includes pharmacy‚Äôs, hospitals and care homes, and never have I ever been notified of a potential exposure."
49,50,wmujcc,Accuracy?,1,2021-01-11 21:56:07,Not sure how accurate the app is. I live in a CCRC with a nursing home and independent living. I was in the main building last Friday getting my first COVID-19 vaccination within spitting distance from the part of the facility where we have had multiple positive tests and several fatalities and I never got any sort of alert from the app. Perhaps I‚Äôm expecting too much.
