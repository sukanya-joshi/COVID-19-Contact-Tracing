0,1,FleetKitten,"Easy to set up, but, needs a tiny bit more work.",4,2020-08-18 17:59:04,"The only thing I wish this app would let me consent to would be access to my iOS Health app. I routinely monitor my temperature for work, and, I believe that the quicker information can be accessed to defeat COVID, the better we can perform contact tracing."
1,2,Sarah54387,Great concept and needed tool - but does not work.,1,2020-09-18 03:42:31,"***Update***  My husband tested positive 2 days ago and immediately reported it on the app. I still show “no exposure” and he has reported 2-3 times to be sure it went through. 

I am SO thankful for the work done on this app. I feel completely safe using it, no names or emails or any information needed - it just uses a low blue tooth signal to know when in range of the app on another device - if which the owner happens to develop COVID-19 and clicks that anonymously on the app then I’ll get an alert if I’ve been in that range in the last 2 weeks. This is a much needed tool to help safely interact and do day to day things like errands and work. I hope a lot of people use this app to help prevent community spread of Covid as restrictions loosen."
2,3,Scott Schram,Privacy-preserving COVID contact tracing,5,2020-08-17 21:42:26,"This is the official Alabama Department of Public Health privacy-preserving Covid contact tracing app. Apple and Google teamed up to create a framework which preserves privacy, does not track your location, and yet can let you know if you may have been exposed.

At some point, Apple and Google will introduce this technology into the operating system, encouraging, but not requiring adoption. 

This looks like a great implementation and is part of the way forward."
3,4,ThunderousMuse,This is a good step,5,2020-08-21 16:42:16,"This is just another tool in the fight. If anyone has privacy concerns they need to read-up on Apple and Google’s mechanism for making this work anonymously.  It’s very elegant and functions in a way which makes it nearly impossible identify or track users.  Don’t just trust me, read what the privacy researchers and encryption engineers have to say about it."
4,5,Smhlol123,Would be helpful if not for issues,1,2020-12-27 01:43:57,"I have had this app for a few months and last night was the first time I actually opened it up to look at it. It showed that I may have been around someone back in October that had COVID and I am not gonna dispute that because I was in Nashville so it’s possible. This morning at 4:50 it sent me a notification again, I was in the bed sleep and then just sent me one 2 hours ago and I am at home alone. So I have not been around anyone during those two times and yet getting notifications. I guess I am a threat to myself"
5,6,Shibby_Dude :D,Great Step but Needs to be Universally Adopted,5,2020-09-17 14:01:18,"I have this downloaded and am tracking my exposure, but you know with all the conservatives here, they’ll be afraid to adopt this app. I’m afraid, because of this, there will be exposure from people left undetected. This is a great and novel app and idea and I’m all for it. But it needs to be universally adopted in order to be most accurate."
6,7,abl710,Notify’s you 14 days after exposure,1,2020-12-06 20:15:17,"Great idea but it’s useless our son has a positive confirmation & notified the app of a positive Covid-19 test. Our phones are telling us that we have had no exposures in the past 14 days & it clearly states it takes 14 days to notify you of possible exposure, which is useless, it needs to be on a day to day basis not every two weeks. Some may be in the hospital when they are notified two weeks later & have spread it to countless others! Waste of time!"
7,8,Emily6403,"All for one, and one for all",5,2020-08-19 21:18:46,"Great privacy protections in place and complete anonymity for users. Just like masks, the more people who will use this app for the benefit of their community (not themselves), the better. Every little bit helps."
8,9,digduggler,Worth trying out,5,2020-08-17 14:01:38,"It’s not a magic bullet, but a good piece of the puzzle if people will use it. Help stop the spread."
9,10,Nebulous_blue,Disproportionate data,1,2020-08-25 23:09:39,"This app doesn't work for any phone user with an operating system lower than 13.5 - most iPhone 6 users run on 12.4. While this app is promising and will help with contact tracing, not being compatible with older OS & phone systems leaves out a large swath of people & data points, which will also disproportionately affect vulnerable groups of people."
10,11,Light dan,"Exposed, both use the app, but got no notification",1,2020-12-08 16:56:38,"My wife and I both use this app. We both got COVID. I reported my test result but even after days my wife got no notification that she had been exposed. 
Unfortunately this app does not do what it is supposed to."
11,12,pkdavidstorm,Great Job Alabama!!,5,2020-08-18 04:10:08,"Went to UA, and I’m proud that Alabama was on top of getting this app created. This will be a vital tool for combatting COVID."
12,13,Hannah0095,Awful,1,2020-09-10 18:34:38,This app does not work. I was with my friend for two hours the night before she tested positive for Covid and never got a notification of exposure. She reported her positive test to the app twice and still nothing.
13,14,Cuffem74,Needs help,3,2020-12-01 19:42:01,Been trying to do my part and report my positive test.  Have been waiting for over 2 hours now to get a code to allow me to finish it
14,15,OhHeyAlan,Doesn’t work,1,2020-12-02 03:11:35,"What’s the point of having the app if it doesn’t work? I never get the code test to me so I can report my positive test result...

How much tax payer money funded this broken app???"
15,16,Mike Evers421,Accessibility concerns with voice over,3,2020-08-28 14:58:29,"Well I believe this app was designed with good intentions, the developers did not consider the knees of the blind or visually impaired users who rely on the voiceover screen reader. When I try to sign into the health check portion for my organization, the links will not activate even when I navigate to them using the voiceover screen reader. It is very difficult to get into the area where I can login my username and password for my organization and then fill out the health check assessment. Please have the developers fix these issues immediately, because this is a requirement for all staff and students at the university of south Alabama and other universities across the state. If you’re going to design an app and require everyone use it, you need to make sure that you have considered all of the needs of all users. This includes users who have disabilities or who are blind or visually impaired. Thank you."
