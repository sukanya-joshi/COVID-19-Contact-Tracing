0,1,rebuhsait,great - please make it work across states,5,2020-08-07 10:59:56,"Great that we can use this app to help contact tracing and fight covid. 

It took 5 weeks longer to develop than swisscovid and lacks the nice graphics but otherwise seems to do the job. 

It was a bit of o struggle to make it work since i had swisscovid installed and enabling notifications didn’t work until i deinstalled swisscovid - without getting clear instructions from the installer. Would be great if one app would work everywhere or if at least switching was easy - uninstall and i stall different app may be acceptable for international travel but not for each trip to Maryland or NC."
1,2,Niraj4,Review from Information Security officer,5,2020-10-19 04:30:26,"This is a great app, designed with privacy first in mind. There is no way for anyone to know your information. 

Let your friends and family know and ask them to download the app. It can save their life. The more people download it, the better it becomes. 

I had a colleague receive a notification about possibly being exposed. He went to get tested and sure enough he was positive. He did not have symptoms but he self quarantined and saved his elderly parents from exposure. Download and spread the word! We can fight this virus out together."
2,3,Hope For Virginia,Great App - Hoping For Many VA Users,5,2020-08-13 02:54:03,"The concept and apparent approach to contact tracking via this app will be great if Virginia can advertise to the state and get many people to use the app. Maybe VA can pass out a flyer with info on the app when someone gets tested for COVID-19. 

It was easy to install and setup. 

Would be great if there was a status indicator or counters that show that it is actually working. Maybe a status page with a counter showing past encounters with other app users or date and time when another user was nearby,"
3,4,Specopsguy!,Finally doing something,5,2020-08-06 17:53:34,"I am glad to see this tracing/tracking App to help fight the pandemic. It was a fast download and will be great in tracking transmissions and COVID-19 exposures. My entire family have downloaded it to help keep us safe. Like not wearing a mask, we stay completely away from folks that don’t have this App as you have no way to know where or with whom they have interacted. Pending a vaccine, this is useful to keep everybody safe. If concerns arise later, one can always delete the App or scrub the phone."
4,5,britney.phoi,PLEASE DOWNLOAD,5,2020-08-06 01:31:27,Your privacy is protected. This doesn’t use your location and you can read all about your concerns in the FAQ on the VHD website about it. It’s a safe app and needs more users for it to be as effective as it can be!! Some may argue that it needs to have more info about COVID hotspots but this is certainly better than nothing and will hopefully have updated soon. And it does NOT drain your battery. Please download this and be a team player
5,6,fasttrak7,Fix the notifications,1,2020-08-19 23:29:08,"I keep Bluetooth turned off when at home, only turn it on when I leave the house. Both for security, as well as battery saving. This app is CONSTANTLY bugging me to turn on Bluetooth - about once every hour or two. As if that’s not annoying enough, the app even bugs me IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT!! Really?! If you want to remind me once, in case I really did forget to turn on Bluetooth, then fine. But any more than that, and it’s a real nuisance. And this nonsense with being repeatedly woken up in the middle of the night - every night - reminding me to turn on Bluetooth...I’m over it. Deleting the app; if you fix the notification issue, I’ll consider reinstalling."
6,7,angelpjela,Can’t Tell if App Works,2,2020-08-27 21:52:22,"Have had the app for a couple of weeks with no alerts, and there is no way to tell if the app is working. Some reviewers mentioned a weekly text saying that they had no exposure in the previous week, but I have not received any such report. I am not sure this app will be useful if it relies completely on exposed or infected people to self-report. At the very least users should be able to click somewhere to learn how many new exposures were added daily and how many exposure notifications the app has made. So that way we would have at least some notion that it’s working."
7,8,23 woud,App,5,2020-08-06 12:47:37,"A lot of people scared of change, we have moved into the technical aspects of life . Video schooling,video doctors appointments mobile banking. Now this , a app that will help you track a deadly disease and people don’t want to use it . This  app should have been downloaded 100,000 time this morning to keep all of us safe. If used correctly we can get back to a somewhat normal life and who does not want that ."
8,9,Herbiecat,Does NOT work!,1,2020-12-07 18:57:43,"This app is very poorly designed & does not work! I recently found out that I came in contact with several people who were positive with COVID-19 & not once was I alerted! I am now fighting COVID-19 from exposure to one of those people I came in contact with. 
Also, it doesn’t even work when you want to report your own case of exposure to Covid-19!! I have tried over & over to enter the PIN number given to me by a Health Dept case worker & the COVIDWISE app keeps saying to re-enter because I have entered PIN number incorrectly!! 
Instead of wasting taxpayers money on this worthless app how about use the money to help those fighting the virus & unable to work while sick!"
9,10,'zeh,Not bad,5,2020-08-05 19:46:27,"There’s not much to the app, including ads. Having said that, I don’t think it’s supposed to have much. It does exactly what it says it’s supposed to do, without ads. 
It doesn’t ask for any permissions (except notifications, of course!). It doesn’t ask for personal information. There’s not much to it (in the way of interactions). 
Oh, did I mention that there aren’t any ads? 
Five stars. Thanks."
10,11,manyamile,I appreciate the privacy first model,5,2020-08-05 18:40:35,"I’m not one to install an app like this due to privacy concerns but after reading through the methods used for generating tokens and what data is and isn’t collected, I’m on board. There’s a great article out by MIT challenging the 60% app adoption rate myth and it shows how every user adds value to the system. As long as the app continues to value my privacy, I’ll gladly let it run on my phone."
11,12,doogietunes,Pat on the back for VDH,5,2020-08-05 16:38:21,"This app is simple, lightweight, respectful of privacy (thanks to the clever decentralized Apple/Google API it’s built on), and plainly worded about what it does. I will be encouraging everyone I know in the commonwealth to install this app and turn it on.

Thank you to VDH for demonstrating leadership, making Virginia the first state in the union to use this technology. Like mask wearing, this tech is no magic bullet, but from what I can see it will certainly help."
12,13,22622482,Confusing...,2,2020-08-20 12:37:22,"Received a (push?) notification in late evening saying I may have had a potential exposure. This notification even included a Bluetooth data listing for a number of hours previous (though did not appear to indicate when this alleged exposure occurred). In trying to look at this notification more thoroughly in the app, the notification was not in there. Furthermore, the “Exposure” section, indicates I have not had an exposure. So, why did I receive this (alarming) late night notice which disappeared? Did I have an exposure or not?"
13,14,mic.overtone,I feel safe using this,5,2020-08-06 00:03:07,"We give our privacy away for the sake of convenience everyday, and this app doesn't even ask for that. 

Only permissions that I was required to OK were notifications and contact tracing. No location services, no motion information, not even my name. You download the app, press OK twice, and you're done. No setup, no room for exploitation."
14,15,RockGardener,No unexpected permissions requests,5,2020-08-05 22:04:46,"It’s too soon to know how well it works, but they got the most important part right! 

During install iOS only prompts for two approvals as expected; “Enable COVID-19 Exposure Logging and Notifications” and “ ‘COVIDWISE’ Would Like To Send You Notifications” 

This app appears to do what it says it does and nothing more, leaving my privacy intact."
15,16,Syboney409,Great app!  Everyone in the Washington area should use it!,5,2020-11-10 16:07:59,This app does a great job of maintaining personal data privacy and at the same time helps to do contact tracing and early warning of possible contagion.  I just hope people are given incentives to install it on their phones since the more the merrier!!!
16,17,Bokamba,Battery drain issue resolved?,4,2020-12-23 06:48:12,"The app drained 25% of my battery over 24 hours, according to iOS, even though I spent almost that entire period at home and did not go to any crowded places. Deleting and reinstalling the app may have fixed the battery drain, though that meant losing the potential contact information stored prior to that point."
17,18,TheEricZ,Needs more data,2,2020-09-08 03:40:02,"I am a data guy, so naturally I would like to see more data. This App doesn’t show anything until maybe when you are positive or in close contact with someone who is tested positive.

This makes using the app not “rewarding” at all! Can’t we just show a few interesting metrics such as how many encounters you have each day? I am in VA, yet I don’t know how many people have the app, and in a normal grocery shopping how many possible encounters that I can have."
18,19,Safe-at-home,Anything to do MY part,5,2020-08-05 18:45:45,"Watching Gov Northam now and gladly sign up for COVIDWISE.  For so long I’ve stayed heathy by quarantine at home, safe distancing, and wearing my masks out of the house.  But, what can I personally do to help fight the spread of Covid-19.  COVIDWISE helps me to do MY part in my community.  More signups directly translates into more successfully controlling Covid-19.  Please sign up yourself and help us all to be safer."
19,20,Tiramisu8402,"Easy to use, great step in the covid fight!",5,2020-08-09 18:13:19,"I’m proud to be a Virginian! I hope many people download this. The app took like 3 seconds to set up, is secure & anonymous. It would be great if the developer adds a content section with updates on covid-related recommendations, changes to local distancing/mask laws, and an updated symptom list, like the CDC Covid app has."
20,21,sharkchompchomp,Glad I downloaded the app,5,2020-08-06 15:40:20,"As soon as I turned on Bluetooth I immediately saw someone in my neighborhood had tested positive.  Granted you can’t see who or where they are (so zero personal details being shared which is a relief), but it’s way better than flying in blind like we were before."
21,22,krayzie999,Amazing app! Go VA!,5,2020-08-07 14:34:33,"This app should have been something the federal government published and should have been promoted nationally. Kudos to VA for taking the first step. 

People who are reporting ENEErrors 14 - it’s because you are on older or beta iOS versions. Please don’t write negative reviews when using older or beta versions of iOS."
22,23,Jeffroman316,Bluetooth not reloading,1,2020-08-06 00:56:49,"Not trying to bash, just trying to get this seen. Downloaded app this afternoon and saw it created a new Bluetooth connection- 4 capital letters. 
Went to connect to a Bluetooth speaker and my phone wasn’t connecting so I turned off and turned Bluetooth back on. The 4 capital letter Bluetooth connection is gone. 
I have tried cycling Bluetooth as well as closing and restarting the COVIDWISE app- still not creating that Bluetooth connection. 
If this is for tracking and helping people, it should re-create that Bluetooth to work"
23,24,GadgetGirlJen,Is it working?,5,2020-08-09 10:50:51,"Hopefully I never receive or need the notification.  I only wish there were some way to know it's working (e.g. Did I pass by another App user?). Hopefully, in time, the anonymous data can be shared so we can truly ""feel"" like we've made a difference."
24,25,Rubber Lizard,The best option.,5,2020-09-25 19:38:16,"While other public health departments have been notoriously slow to respond to Covid-19, it is great to see an exception. The Virginia COVIDWISE app is the best and only app to take advantage of the cross platform exposure notification platform developed by Apple and Google. A set it and forget it experience. Highly recommended!"
25,26,Reviewer63792-17,A Simple Lifesaver,5,2020-12-27 15:08:59,"This has really brought be peace of mind. Downloaded COVIDWISE a couple months ago and have been able to tell if I have ever been exposed while out and about. 

If everyone where using this app, life could be a lot more normal!"
26,27,TheHammer610,Settings Are Difficult,2,2020-11-23 14:02:34,"I wanted to turn on Availability Alerts but cannot.  It is not listed in Location Services.  The switch is grayed out in the app.  When I went to the VA website for help, I got the following:
[siteorigin_widget class=”WP_Widget_Media_Image”][/siteorigin_widget] Download Virginia’s free COVIDWISE Exposure Notifications app to help protect your community while protecting your privacy. [siteorigin_widget class=”WP_Widget_Media_Image”][/siteorigin_widget] Supported on iOS 13.5 & 13.6, compatible with iPhone."
27,28,Davidswelt3845890,Is this going to work for non-Virginians?,3,2020-09-03 12:55:52,"What happens when someone with this app gets exposed by someone from, say, DC or Maryland, who may have installed a different app?

Rollout, communication on this were bungles. And possibly the technology also if exposure notifications do not work across borders, because let’s face it: people are mobile, whether state officials can imagine that or not."
28,29,Donkadillapig,I work in deep enterprise IT,5,2020-08-11 10:45:43,"And I value my privacy! Nothing I see in this app worries me at all. It’s a solid, discreet implementation. Battery drain claims are bogus, no more than leaving your Bluetooth connection on all the time (which most do) for cars, speakers etc."
29,30,Drf5n,Add full date & go nationwide,4,2020-12-15 18:19:57,"If it displayed the date it wouldn’t be as easy to spoof with a screenshot.

It would also be nice to have nationwide interoperability rather than just virginia-specific tracing. What’s a dc person supposed to do? (Update just in time for holiday travel, the devs write: “COVIDWISE now participates in the National Key Server...” so that’s improved."
30,31,Boomer703,"Parents, coaches and teachers",5,2020-08-07 12:04:48,"If we want to ensure safety of your family, kids, players, teachers and even after there is hopefully a vaccine, this is “the” protective layer needed for us all. Not just for this pandemic but for future outbreaks or even just peace of mind."
31,32,GMU Student,Your privacy is safe,5,2020-08-08 19:27:21,This app doesn’t know who you are or where you are. It relies only on the distance between phones and the strength of your Bluetooth signal. No personal information is shared with google or Apple.
32,33,jan**#,Took a bad turn,1,2020-09-06 21:15:20,"Had it installed for several weeks with no problems. Suddenly, the last two days it drained my battery to zero (from 75%) over the course of 4 hours. Had to delete it today, because I can’t have my phone suddenly dying in the middle of a call, only to find out I have no juice left and leaving me recalling that last I looked it was @ 75%. Too bad; thought it would be a good tool to help out and stay informed."
33,34,danwagner01,Smart & powerful safety precaution,5,2020-08-07 14:58:11,"Five months after schools initially closed here in the U.S., my family remains diligent in the fight against COVID-19. We rarely leave home. When we do leave, we always wear masks and gloves. The CovidWise app is a smart & powerful addition to our strict safety precautions."
34,35,chambere324,Not a help at all,1,2020-12-19 03:22:26,I have been on the Virginia Tech campus from august to November and had multiple confirmed cases in my hall. Not a single notification. I downloaded this app with the hope of keeping myself and those around me safe but all I got was stupid “weekly reports” that consisted of nothing. This app doesn’t work when no one reports. I reported when I came into close contact with a possible case but overall this doesn’t work.
35,36,jjcp94532,Great Idea - One Bad Problem,4,2020-11-25 18:22:08,"Love the app and idea. Especially since I’m a GrubHub and DoorDash driver. But this app conflicts with both GrubHub and DoorDash. When Covidwise app is running the GrubHub and DoorDash new order alarms don’t work. So, Covidwise is unusable when I need it most. Please fix this. Also, how do I find the installed version number of Covidwise?"
36,37,Nobody's Monkey,Shareable link,5,2020-08-06 02:22:17,It would be great if there were a shareable link within the app that you could either post to social media or share via text to encourage others to download.
37,38,SpecelEd,Help your community,5,2020-08-09 20:05:48,This anonymous app will help others understand if they have been exposed to someone who has tested and allow them to not infect others.  Let’s all help one another for once
38,39,AndrewCy,Hope I never have to see this app again!,5,2020-08-05 20:53:17,Thanks for making this and taking advantage of this Apple/Google contact tracing tech. I hope I never have to use it. But I’m glad to know it’s there.
39,40,ForeverafterEmily,An “A” For Effort!,1,2020-09-02 00:41:28,"I live in Los Angeles.  I’ve been within Bluetooth range of a great many other people (3000 maybe?) since I downloaded the app three weeks ago.  Always masked up and socially distanced.  But definitely close enough for this app to do what it is intended to do.

Except it’s not doing anything.  Not a single notification... in Los Angeles... 3000 people!  So either no one is actually reporting being positive, or no one is actually using this app."
40,41,samdlovelaceiv,It Took Long Enough,5,2020-08-07 20:57:09,"Finally! Come on Virginia, we’re a blue state now, this app should have been out weeks ago. It will help future cases, but it could have done much more good had it been released sooner."
41,42,Jtw7a,Happy to see privacy is protected,5,2020-08-05 20:57:36,Glad it is Bluetooth and not GPS based.  As a healthcare worker I hope we can get enough momentum behind apps like this to make contact tracing easier and better!
42,43,tar-tar-binks,PLEASE DOWNLOAD!,5,2020-08-11 05:37:35,Apple and Google already have your location through maps and all the other data they collect. So please at least give you data for a good cause.
43,44,Geoffs Pookie,PookieGirl,5,2020-08-09 01:05:48,I just downloaded the app because I believe all Virginians need to do everything in their power to try to control and overcome this disease. Thank you Virginia for working to keep us all safe.
44,45,RestonDan,Proud of Virginia,5,2020-08-05 14:53:05,"I am so proud of Virginia for being the first state to release an app for contact tracing. As a computer scientist, I understand that the app is privacy sensitive and secure. This should be a useful tool in hammering the virus into the ground. Thank you Virginia for your leadership."
45,46,ForceofEngland,Worth It!,5,2020-08-05 23:42:40,"With nothing private or confidential being shared, this is an app that could save lives! Stay safe, stay healthy, make a difference in your community by downloading this app!"
46,47,M.A.Choreographer,Can you add a feature to share the app?,5,2020-10-17 04:29:10,"To help the usefulness of the app, can you add a feature for users to share the app to social media to get more people using it?"
47,48,Overwatch,"Great, but add contact counter metric",4,2020-08-08 13:09:17,"I think this app is great, but naturally it depends on hitting critical mass adoption to be effective. While that’s growing, can you add a counter in the app to show unique or per-day device interactions so we can see if we even crossed paths with another app user?"
48,49,Tech-savy Grandmother,Come on Fellow Virginians,5,2020-08-09 14:11:22,This was very easy to install. I hope it helps to keep infections down. Let’s all do our part and show that Virginia is a leader in one more area. Thank you.
49,50,petter9957678,push notification w/o any more information,1,2020-09-07 12:39:26,"For the past two weeks, I got a push notification that I was potentially exposed to one person and the next week I was potentially exposed to three people. Yet when I go into the app itself it provides no information and says that I have no past exposures. It makes absolutely no sense and I am this close to deleting it."
50,51,Inane Chuck,Proud to do my part,5,2020-08-05 23:13:24,Glad to see this easy to use tool in the fight against COVID. Noninvasive and protects individual privacy why helping protect the public. Does a job contact tracing alone just cannot accomplish.
51,52,iOSecure,Good - But hard to find. Destroys battery,4,2020-08-14 15:03:17,"Seriously 10-20% hit? Thought it used Bluetooth LE??? 

Please advertise this more aggressively. Most people are completely unaware that this app exists. Apple/Google should be promoting it as banner on App Store to help increase engagement."
52,53,idkwhatnick2put,Solid App and privacy-focused!,5,2020-08-06 13:37:18,I cannot day enough about this. It helps us do our part to stop COVID while maintaining users’ privacy. This is is a must-have app for everyone in Virginia!
53,54,NoZombz,Glad to see This app,5,2020-08-05 18:43:24,This is what it will take to get things back to as close to normal as we can. Glad to see Virginia leading the way and using this technology.  Thanks!
54,55,keybsnbits,Good job Virginia,5,2020-08-05 15:13:36,I’ve been following US/state usage of the Apple and Google Exposure Notification API. For a while I was worried that Virginia’s early enthusiasm would not turn into a usable app. Happy to say I was wrong. Stay safe everybody.
55,56,SecOps 4 Ever,Tracing while protecting privacy,5,2020-08-19 18:08:33,Wonderful addition to the arsenal.  I’m a computer security and privacy proponent and this fits the bill.  Hope we get the general population to join in.

I’m cautiously optimistic!"
57,58,DattMungan,Much Needed App,5,2020-08-06 05:37:33,A program that can and will save lives. Thank you Virginia for doing what is right even when it may be (unnecessarily) hard!
58,59,<tej>,"Simple, safe, private & effective",5,2020-08-08 19:35:59,"Doesn’t get any simpler or safer than this. Help stem the spread. Look at Japan and South Korea, they’re less than 1% infection rate and they’ve been using an app tracer for months."
59,60,Wa2761,Wonderful,5,2020-08-06 00:15:34,"Downloaded the app as soon as I saw it came out. I’m currently slightly sick, not sure if it’s COVID yet. I will get tested and if it comes back positive, I’ll definitely report it on this app."
60,61,mxmeekins,Keeps you and your data safe,5,2020-08-06 03:03:39,I’m glad to see there is zero signup procedures. Just enable Bluetooth and enable push notifications.

66,67,Teri Brown,Straightforward and to the point!,5,2020-08-05 18:29:41,Proud of Virginia for being the first state to make contact tracing easier. The app is straightforward and hopefully helps slow the spread.

74,75,Turbo Turducken,No feedback,4,2020-08-18 16:18:44,"Provides no feedback about the number of other users it’s detected, so there’s no real for the individual to know if it’s working"

76,77,jake.griffin,Impressed,5,2020-08-09 19:38:24,Wow! Great job Virginia creating a contact-tracing app without asking for location or personal identifiers. Gives me a lot of faith in my state.
77,78,Thea In VA,No longer updating,2,2020-08-11 01:10:02,Downloaded and was working great. Now it hasn’t checked or created a log since 1:11 am on 8/7.  There’s no way to troubleshoot or get help. Please fix so it will work again. This is a much needed tool for everyone to help stay safe.
78,79,FellowVirginian!,Enable button doesn’t work?,2,2020-08-05 22:56:33,"Hello! I am a fellow Virginian who cares about the health and safety of my community, so I was a little disappointed when I went on the app and I couldn’t press the enable button to “sensor” for COVID-19 bacteria. I know you are just releasing this, so take your time fixing any bugs. Thanks!"
79,80,gunman8870,Boomers,5,2020-10-20 00:58:20,Don’t listen to all the boomers that don’t know how to set up an app that takes less then a minute lol.
80,81,Orb Sportsball,"Simple, clear set up",5,2020-08-05 21:00:07,"It was quick to set up, and the methodology was made very clear. Good job, Virginia"
81,82,Joe_149,Supports only iOS 13??????,1,2020-08-07 14:00:24,"This app has no features that would prevent it from supporting earlier versions of iOS.  This prevents its use on, for example, iPhone 6, a common phone. 

For an app whose value lies in widespread adoption, this is unacceptable!!

Please tell the developer to change the OS support setting in XCode, rebuild and release this app for earlier versions."
82,83,Sumedh03,Works perfectly.,5,2020-08-16 02:52:04,I hope many VA residents download this app. It protects privacy and works perfectly.
83,84,Thump3rRocks,Fantastic.,5,2020-08-05 19:55:05,Now if we can just get everyone to install and use this.
84,85,DIAMOND 922,App not working,5,2020-10-26 23:22:07,Hi my COVIDWISE app is not working! Is their anyway I can fix it and I can’t see my exposure checks at all please fix it
85,86,cupochicken,Very useful app that everyone in Virginia needs to download,5,2020-09-27 03:41:43,"If everyone got this app, we can finally get rid of COVID."
86,87,GnateTheGreat,Easy to use,5,2020-08-06 15:49:44,Easy to use and a great step forward for the state. Everyone please get this app!

88,89,Harize,Download. No Need To Fear About Privacy.,5,2020-08-06 14:57:41,"The app itself is nice, clean, and intuitive. From somebody who knows tech, this is a very secure app."
89,90,jgray94,Error when enabling Exposure Notifications,1,2020-08-08 13:39:03,What’s the point of the app if the setup process can not be completed? Getting an error: “The operation couldn’t be completed. (ENErrorDomain error 14.)” Also no my phone isn’t running iOS 14 beta. It’s running iOS 13.6 with Bluetooth and Notifications enabled.
90,91,APriday,Very convenient!,5,2020-08-05 22:34:16,Super easy way to track exposure and transmission!  I hope all states adopt this app!
91,92,Dcpaskie,Great app but would add vaccine,4,2020-12-18 17:41:11,It’s a great app. I would say that it would be extra useful if you add a tracking for self-reporting vaccine being administered.
92,93,LightBox22,Won’t uninstall,1,2020-09-30 11:35:56,I’m uncertain but I believe this app may be draining my battery. Since ios14 the health app is the using 36% of my battery health while using almost no on screen time. I turned off the covid tracking and am unable to “Remove” the app by long pressing on the app icon.
93,94,casawi86,No GPS data is colleceted,5,2020-08-06 05:04:25,I hope more people will use it to stop the spread of the virus.

I went through steps developer outlined in other reviews. Still doesn’t work. Pretty frustrating."
95,96,1 Star all you deserve,This app is missing the most important reason to exist,1,2020-09-28 22:12:50,I personally know over 25 positive cases in Roanoke City right now. This app unfortunately has not detected or reported them. I don’t work close to the them or in they’re department and had not been told anything by those in HR.
96,97,unknown??????unknown,Thanks,5,2020-09-10 17:37:50,Thanks for spending the time and effort to paylessly make this and keep us safe :)
97,98,iNomis,Needs better battery management,2,2020-08-11 12:50:14,This app is great except for me it uses too much of the battery. Not sure if there is way to fix but want developers to know it’s an issue.
98,99,chrisvonsimson,Really clear and easy,5,2020-08-05 19:48:41,"Super easy way to help yourself and others, for free."
99,100,Joannski3,Doesn’t work,1,2020-12-31 21:12:17,"Got my text to say I tested positive for covid from my swab on 12/27. I looked at the lab results and had a 6 digit number that ended in a -6 (I did not not could include the dash).

Have no idea how I’m supposed to notify others exposed to me if I can’t even get a pin"
100,101,Mazeppa,The commonwealth leads the way!,5,2020-08-06 02:30:27,Very proud of Virginia for being the first state to launch a coronavirus tracking app!
101,102,Tom from Wmsbg,R Thompson,5,2020-08-05 18:57:24,Proud of our state leadership and collaboration in a time when it is so vitality needed.  Another excellent initiative in this battle!
102,103,Steve Davidson,So glad VA offers this,5,2020-10-26 03:56:17,Everyone should have this app!
103,104,potentialdem503,Great app,5,2020-08-05 23:02:44,"This app is a great way to keep Virginians safer, definitely would recommend it!"
104,105,hehsbebdvcgshbdbs,Good job!,5,2020-08-26 16:28:37,I’m so happy that we’re taking more steps to try and fight COVID-19! Thank you for this app. 👍🏼
105,106,RaghuPole,Not able to use,1,2020-08-11 12:49:25,"Getting error while enabling notifications and there is no info on how to troubleshoot.

106,107,Dwdwdw1985,Use this!,5,2020-08-06 15:47:49,The security and privacy promises are legitimate. Use this app to help slow the spread of the virus.
107,108,Bruingolf04,Happy to see it,5,2020-08-05 14:23:40,Glad VA is ahead of the game utilizing available tech to bring awareness to the risks.
108,109,Chloe8950,Easy & Private,5,2020-08-06 02:05:01,Looks well done.
109,110,Slurm_Loco,Tested positive and wasn’t able to use the app,1,2020-12-19 00:28:09,I tested positive and I tried to use COVIDWISE to alert others. Unfortunately I was never able to as I never received the pin needed to send the message out. What’s the point of the app if I can’t get a pin?
110,111,jessappleg8,Thankful,5,2020-08-05 19:55:28,I’m thankful for an app like this and for a state with a governor who’s educated and does what’s best for our state. Great idea.
111,112,chuckadisc,Happy to Help!,5,2020-08-05 23:31:27,Very excited this is finally ready!
112,113,Rory A,Doesn’t work,1,2020-12-13 01:56:01,Tried to report a positive case “me” I needed a PIN number and didn’t give me away to get one. Have no interest in having apps that don’t work on my phone.  Also failing to send status reports.
113,114,Hungercraft,Not From VA,5,2020-08-05 15:19:54,Nothing about this technology gates this to only users in VA. I'm in WA and downloaded this. Spread this app!
114,115,Miyhishia,confused??,1,2020-08-22 23:43:15,I received a push notification that I came in contact however when i open the app it says no exposure. I can no longer find these notifications was I exposed or no????
115,116,Suryonhan,Awesome app,5,2020-08-06 19:29:26,Super simple and love the interface. Thank you!!!
116,117,EdgiestSafe,ultimate battery sucker,1,2020-12-26 01:48:31,I reinstalled the app because I needed something to drain my battery quickly so that I could test how quickly the phone would charge back up.
117,118,Rw tarot,Covid logs not working,1,2020-08-10 19:09:11,I love the concept but my log exposures have not been working since aug 7 and i have friends that say theyre having the same issue with this pls fix it asap so we can use this great idea to help beat covid 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

125,126,SDRice,Doesn’t install,1,2020-12-07 21:22:35,Just gets stuck in a constant loop of asking me to turn on exposure notifications. Goes back and forth between setting and COVIDWISE. It never turns on.
126,127,interlard,Annoying Bluetooth alert every day!,1,2020-11-08 15:56:43,Every day I turn off airplane mode this stupid app pops up an alert to tell me out only works when Bluetooth is enabled. Argh!!
