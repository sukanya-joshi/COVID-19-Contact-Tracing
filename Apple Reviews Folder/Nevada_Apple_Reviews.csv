0,1,820TD,Needed to adjust text size,3,2020-08-25 01:44:27,Tried to start the Covid Tracer App on my iPhone 8 but the ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù button overlapped the toggle and I could not turn on the app.  After some tinkering I had to adjust the text size in settings to separate the ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù button from the toggle and I was then able to turn the app on.
1,2,Pad10one,Time stamp problem - NOW FIXED,5,2020-09-09 23:20:50,"Now that I have the app installed for a few days now every time I open the app the page says ‚Äú No exposures found within the last hour ‚Äú. Then underneath that is always says ‚ÄúLast checked 5:30pm‚Äù.  Well 5:30pm was 23 hours ago so how would it know I didn‚Äôt have exposure In the last hour if the last time it checked was 23 hours ago?  Something isn‚Äôt right or this app isn‚Äôt working properly. Which is it?

Update,  No the update to version 1.1 did not corrected the problem.  I even uninstalled and reinstalled.  No matter what time stamp does not change.

Update - app is now fixed with latest update.  Changing from 2 stars to 5 stars.  Now I just wish more people would get the app so we can really know if we are being exposed."
2,3,MME Angel,Back to 5 stars,5,2020-11-16 22:48:53,"Nevada COVID Trace app back to working great. Recently, since iOS 14.2, I was getting ‚Äòunable to connect to server.‚Äô Deleted app, reinstalled it, shut-down iPhone 8, - when I opened the app (after reinstall) it did show a current time. However, when checking again, I got the same ‚Äòunable to connect to server‚Äô message, with no time update. Later today app is functioning as it should again - updating time-stamp for ‚Äòlast‚Äô exposure check."
3,4,Fatsai,Not Accurate or Effective-Just Tracks the Individual,1,2020-12-26 14:25:03,"I personally have discovered at least 10 people I have been within close proximity had tested positive for the virus and 8 had the NV app on their phone as well.. Notably, it was not told to me until after they had quarantined for at least 2 weeks. Also, I have been tested 3 times and all were negative. Regardless, the app never alerted I had been exposed. This app clearly is mainly tracking the individual‚Äôs who load it, not really whether they have been exposed as it indicates. Do not recommend using it for anything other than quick access to statistics.  Personally, I deleted the app."
4,5,johnwillo,Unable to connect to server,1,2020-09-10 16:11:39,"The COVID Trace Nevada app seemed to work for a few days, but now does not update the time of last check. When I try to force an update, it tells me that it cannot connect to its server. I recently updated to iOS 13.7, perhaps this was the cause? The app was initially installed on iOS 13.6.1 and appeared to work. App is up to date.

Update: Despite developer assurances, the new version of the app still cannot connect to server, even after a delete-and-reinstall. Perhaps a spurious error message? After the re-install, the last check time DID update. Once."
5,6,TheMadCow,Accessibility Settings,4,2020-08-25 13:17:09,You need to address the bug that has been mentioned others. The slider needs to be dynamic so that those that have larger dynamic text turned on can access it. This is going to frustrate a lot of people that that might just delete the app because of this.
6,7,kaf702,Please advertiser more,5,2020-08-29 20:14:38,"We need was many possible people to use it, INCLUDING visitors to the state. Are all hotels, medical facilities, hospitals & colleges putting it in their welcome packages? This will help get our tourism economy back on track of we can get everyone to use it.
Social media too!"
7,8,Corona plus,Not helping,1,2020-12-07 18:59:11,I don‚Äôt understand. Is this to help people or to frustrate them? I tried to register myself as someone that tested positive for Covid. Your app would not let me do it unless I had a confirmation number. If someone gave me such a number I was too sick to hear it.. Why are you making it difficult for people to help each other? Isn‚Äôt that the purpose of the app? You must find an easier way for people to register their information.
8,9,Shellibean96,App wants a special number I don‚Äôt have access to,1,2020-11-30 23:26:05,I only downloaded the app so I could alert people I have been in contact with that I am positive for covid currently BUT the app wants a verification 8 digit number from a health official that I do not have ??? I have my test results and this number they‚Äôre asking for does not exist. I guess I can‚Äôt warn anybody and my boyfriend also has covid but it says there are no active warnings in my area lol I AM the active warning
9,10,.moca.,FRUSTRATING,1,2020-12-31 06:17:13,"When I first installed this app it worked great. Then it stopped. I have reinstalled it several times and I still continue to get the same message ‚Äúexposure notification off‚Äù because my bluetooth is off. It‚Äôs on. When the app did work, I never had my bluetooth on. ü§î Very frustrating and not sure it‚Äôs worth any more of my time. As I read the reviews it appears I‚Äôm not the only one feeling this way. üòï"
10,11,Cvintage59,Turn it on,3,2020-08-24 18:32:00,I saw this app advertised on Fox news on Saturday they said it would be available in Nevada on Monday it‚Äôs 11:30 in the morning and I still cannot turn the app on I would very much like to use this app if someone can please activate it that would be great
11,12,stacidbach,Doesn‚Äôt Work,1,2020-08-25 17:08:00,"I downloaded the app for iPhone. I have the latest iOS. I clicked through the app and when I got to ‚ÄúEnable exposure notifications‚Äù, there‚Äôs a slider to enable, however it‚Äôs ‚Äúhidden‚Äù under the continue button and won‚Äôt allow me to enable notifications, nor will it let me advance. So, I unfortunately deleted it since it‚Äôs basically useless. If they ever get it working I might consider downloading again."
12,13,zachlasvegas,Works for me. Needs more awareness,4,2020-11-10 20:49:03,I only just found out about this apps existence today. This could really help if more people were aware of it and downloaded. I‚Äôm not sure if this app would tell me I was exposed for any visitors from out of state
13,14,asharf 702,This app is a joke,1,2020-09-18 14:26:15,I doubt this app is working I had it on my phone for over two weeks now and for the past two weeks I‚Äôve been in every place in Vegas it didn‚Äôt notify me once that I‚Äôve been exposed to the virusI i mean I‚Äôve been to grocery stores restaurants casinos and work it‚Äôs impossible that I haven‚Äôt been near someone with a virus and have the app on his phone but somehow I never got notified
14,15,Dont dl this game,App no longer works after recent update,1,2020-11-20 03:22:10,"App no longer functional since most recent update (4 days ago from this review). App now says exposure notifications are off because background data fetch is off. It‚Äôs on and the app won‚Äôt recognize this...plus the previous version didn‚Äôt have this issue. Massive failure during a massive outbreak, great work devs!"
15,16,carrie winter,Tracking,1,2020-08-28 05:16:49,This app does not give you a day or time when you have been checked. I tried it for a few days and it always said no exposure and it always said the checking time was the same time each day. I need more information before I sign up again for this app. It‚Äôs a good idea how ever it needs a date of when you were checked.
16,17,JesseSlatton,New Update,1,2020-11-26 02:00:24,"I‚Äôm not going to use this anymore. After the new update, one has to have ‚ÄòBackground App Refresh‚Äô turned on in iOS. I don‚Äôt like that setting on as it wastes battery life, and most apps don‚Äôt need to be refreshing on their own if your not connected to cellular data or Wifi. Plus, this app isn‚Äôt going to really help if people aren‚Äôt inputting their positive tests."
17,18,Liane00,Easy to Install; TBD if it‚Äôs effective,5,2020-08-27 16:27:18,I‚Äôm just sure if the app was approved but it took me 30 seconds to download it and enable the two features by sliding on the button.
18,19,renokris,Is it working?,2,2020-12-09 06:01:31,"I downloaded the app and enabled all notifications. However, when I open the app there is a big yellow box on the Exposures screen the says Exposure Notification is Off. I enabled everything possible in Settings and in the app. Not sure if the app is working or not. üòï"
19,20,iOSJake,Nice idea - I hope more people use it,5,2020-08-28 20:54:45,We should all be using it. It doesn‚Äôt seem to impact my battery life at all.
20,21,Sally MV,Doesn‚Äôt work- my alerts are all on,3,2020-12-10 17:31:30,I have all notifications on and the app says I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve checked it multiple times.
21,22,nikonpointer,Stopped working,1,2020-11-21 19:37:54,"After a few weeks, it now says in yellow ‚Äúnotifications off‚Äù, press here to turn on. 

However, no place to go to fix the issue. It also says my logs haven‚Äôt been checked in 14 days!  iPhone 12ProMax iOS 14.2.1. There is no tech support anywhere in the app or on the web that I can find. Kinda useless."
22,23,Semper Ludus,"Simple, Anonymous, and Critical",5,2020-08-25 00:24:17,This App is easy to use and will help the State keep you informed about any risk of exposure to COVID. Stay safe and help others.  A MUST if you live in Nevada or visit.
23,24,Aidenn,Can‚Äôt activate it on my phone!,2,2020-08-25 14:02:14,"On my iPhone 8, the third screen has a switch that needs to be flipped ‚Äòon‚Äô to ‚ÄòEnable exposure notifications‚Äô, but a ‚ÄòContinue‚Äô button is in the way. I can‚Äôt scroll the switch above the ‚ÄòContinue‚Äô button to activate the app."
24,25,yoh4il3y,The more the merrier,5,2020-08-26 18:08:38,This is an awesome app and the more people that use it the more effective it is!  Tell your friends to download :)
25,26,NV_Gal,Bug fixed fast‚Äîhelpful app,5,2020-08-27 10:42:32,Start bug was fixed fast.
26,27,Vegasluk,Useless use of tax payer money,1,2020-12-12 00:34:35,‚ÄúIf‚Äù you were exposed the app wont tell you when or where. You have to run the exposure checks manually and every Monday the app will just let you know whether or not you were exposed and if you were exposed you wouldn‚Äôt know until cdc gets back to you.
27,28,Madmex1234,I can‚Äôt click continue on bluetooth screen,4,2020-08-24 23:53:10,The Continue button is greyed out and is over the toggle to enable bluetooth for the app. I have an iPhone SE.

29,30,MTguy23,Pure White Screen,1,2020-09-18 23:56:03,"I am running the new iOS 14.  You should have beta-tested with this.  I‚Äôm not sending a screenshot, because like others, my screen is plain white.  The status bar has the usual system stuff.  It just parks at that point.  Using an iPhone XR.  Why do I have to give one star?"
30,31,Andy U,Make sure you have text size small,1,2020-08-24 02:16:06,As you go through the setup screens it freezes on ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù where it has slide button. You can‚Äôt complete the setup if you use large text setting. Reduce the text size and then it works.

33,34,RedRockRules,Can‚Äôt Get Past Second Screen - iPhone,1,2020-08-24 18:50:11,Unfortunately the app does not support iPhone use. Second screen continue button hides ability to slide the button at the bottom of screen to allow notifications.
34,35,RemiMomNevada,Problem with the app,1,2020-10-30 22:12:39,Not very useful. I tried to use the notify others part of the app but it will not let me put my Covid ID number in because my number is 7 digits and it wants 8. You need to get it together if it is going to be useful.
35,36,lvames,Doesn‚Äôt even open,1,2020-11-18 06:49:16,After downloading and trying to open the app it only showed a blank white screen. I tried a couple of times and still nothing happens.
