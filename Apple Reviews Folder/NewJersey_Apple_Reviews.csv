0,1,hunnyybea,"Glad to have it, hope for a few more features",4,2020-10-30 16:31:35,"Very grateful to have this available and i hope many more download/use this for contact tracing in our state. Well done on making this easy for us!

That said i do agree with other users that i wished it had more info. You cant zoom on the “total cases” graphs which makes them very hard to view. 

It would be much more helpful to have a tracker of New Cases from the last 24-48 hours instead of the “totals” since april so that we can better see where we currently stand and the graph isnt totally skewed from the spike in april when testing finally started."
1,2,R5A9,Exposure Alert can’t work if county health departments don’t have the info to provide,2,2020-11-13 13:02:15,"Sadly the app has been available for over a month and there are less than 330k downloads.

To make matter worse, the exposure alert feature is a complete waste. I tested positive this week (test Monday, results from lab Wednesday morning, finally contacted by Ocean County Health Department Thursday afternoon). When I asked the OCHD person that called about the tracking number to enter into the app she had no idea what I was talking about yet claims to have been doing Ocean County contact tracing since March. She said she’d make a call and get back to me. I thought that may have meant same day, but it’s now Friday and no call back. 

I wanted this app to work . I’ve had it installed since early October when there were less than 100k users, but in a state with 9 million people to have less than 330K download it and for county health departments to have no clue (or the information to provide)  a month after release, this is not going to help reduce the number of cases in the state."
2,3,E3478,17+ rating a bit surprising,4,2020-11-14 18:17:02,"This app has been useful, but I was surprised that when I downloaded it to my child’s phone, the app said my child was too young to participate. I downloaded it because they are going to resume limited in-person instructionat school, and this app seemed like something they should have. I’d be interested to hear why those under 17 cannot participate."
3,4,Tkim66,Take it up a notch,4,2020-10-29 14:05:44,This app would be even better if a user is alerted in real time if they are in close proximity of someone who is positive that isn’t quarantined. Maybe that would be too “big brother is watching” concept but it would be more useful than being alerted after the fact.
4,5,Raviss1,Great app needed badly,5,2020-10-04 11:50:06,"The app has a minor installation issue, it gave an error 1002 message. Contacted support and they replied within 2 hrs and told me to turn off WiFi. It won’t install if you are on WiFi. Turned off WiFi and it installed.  The problem is only with Verizon. 
It is easy to use and understand."
5,6,Jdnj828,Covid alert is useless,1,2020-12-13 14:35:21,"When receiving an alert that my “phone” was in the vicinity of another “phone” where the owner has tested positive, no other details are given. When was the contact? Where was the contact? How long did it last? All of this is needed to make a proper self- assessment of my own risk. If I walked past someone at the grocery store who later tested positive, I’m not quarantining for 14 days. This app just feeds into panic and unnecessary worry. I agree that contact tracing is needed, but it has to be based on scientific rationale."
6,7,cssc119,Love the app make it social,5,2020-11-24 05:20:18,"Hey can we send some encouraging words or send money to those in need or alerts on where they can find food? Set up food delivery. I think if we make it more social and interactive (with a nonFacebook algorithm, positive vibes only) it can be a community builder! Like the Ring app but for for the Rona."
7,8,JackSher,Error,4,2020-10-07 22:54:44,"Initially I received an error every time I tried to install it. However, I was contacted by the developer, and they explained that you need to turn off Wi-Fi when you install it. That definitely is a bug, but they are trying to fix it. Once installed, it works great."
8,9,iPodX7,Not the best but hopeful that it’ll improve,5,2020-10-07 02:08:01,People like to run to hit that one star on apps like it’s the only update they’ll do on any app. It’s ridiculous. And although this app needs more improvements I’m sure it’ll get there. I’m just glad they got something going on.
9,10,Cory Monteleone,Well Implemented and Clear,5,2020-10-03 01:38:45,"Aside from wanting the ability to get daily reminders to do the wellness screening, the app is simple, clean, and concise. I'm pretty proud of my State's ability to grasp technology and make things that make life better. Thank you and stay safe."
10,11,NJeffrey,Turn off Wi-Fi when setting it up,4,2020-10-07 23:13:00,"Kept getting error 1002, even after redownloading app.  Found out you need to turn off the Wi-Fi when first setting it up, then you can turn it back on.  So far, looks good."
11,12,DavidEvan,"Good initial effort, but no city community or town level info",3,2020-10-17 16:07:54,"I thought this app would tell me who around has COVID and what places in town or stores to avoid. I suspect most danger zones are local nursing homes but I’ve no way to know if a grocery store or school us contaminated.

Also the survey form doesn’t work in Safari. Says Safari isn’t supported."
12,13,ScruffyBear13,For people experiencing 1002 or 1005 error...,4,2020-10-03 05:23:46,"If you are experiencing this error the website says to turn off WiFi and try again. Worked for me! Great app, great idea to help keep people safe."
13,14,JayySur,Needs update to fit the iPhone 12 mini,3,2020-11-17 20:51:34,"I just got the iPhone 12 mini. I notice that the app isn’t properly formatted to fit it. The tabs are too close to the bottom. The app still works, but the user interface isn’t pleasant to look at. Please fix this!"
14,15,louisluccidotcom,Oct 2 review(hope I can update when it actually works),1,2020-10-03 15:06:21,"Super excited to be a concerned citizen and participate, tell the app I’m older than 18, get to the next screen and click to move to the next step: ERROR: 1002. As a control I also downloaded the NY covid alert app and it works with no errors. Tried deleting and reinstalling, deleting the NY alert app and trying to reinstall the NJ app; same error no matter what I try."
15,16,asfcssfcxccd,"Nice, but big flaw (for now)",3,2020-12-30 00:02:58,"It’s a useful app, and it works fine on my other devices, BUT I can’t even download it on my iPhone 6 because it says I need to update to iOS 13, but the thing is, iOS 12.5 introduces exposure notifications, and I really wanted to use this app."
16,17,Magic Mike XL,Thank you!,5,2020-10-01 21:54:09,"Special thanks to Governor Murphy, his administration and the developers of this app for putting together a system of alerting residence about this horrible virus for the new age. We can beat this virus, together."
17,18,Ice Storm Bravo,Under 18 limitation is idiotic,3,2020-10-03 16:10:44,Not being allowed for those residents under 18 is absolutely asinine. This is why we are in the mess we are in. Too much “in-the-box”thinking and slow movement. This app should have been launched in April and required by state law. Let’s get on with it.
18,19,BreakingCustoms,Useful but severely reduces battery life,3,2020-10-08 20:00:53,"Glad to see a tool out there that helps track cases, but this thing eats battery life. On average, this app uses 30% of my battery a day. Had to disable for the time being"
19,20,Csandst1,Typo in intro,5,2020-10-01 19:44:19,In the intro that comes up after downloading the app (I think it’s the first page) there’s a typo—it says identify when it should say identity.
20,21,AMGTHIS,Worked after Dev feeeback,4,2020-10-07 22:52:50,I was able to get the app up and running. Sort of silly to require turning off Wi-Fi in order to setup the app.
21,22,BB1264,Cannot complete setup!!!,1,2020-10-02 20:46:01,"I’ve been trying to install for the last 2 days, but consistently receive a “error 1002” message when trying to advance past the Data Usage page (first step after selecting Getting Started)! Not sure where to turn to for help."
22,23,leeshfimp,Missing one thing,4,2020-10-02 17:30:46,Would be great having quick access to the hot spot list
23,24,Thoyl,How do you know?,4,2020-10-16 21:02:34,"I like this app, however, I would like to know what the alert looks like if it needs to notify me of exposure.

Anybody know??"
24,25,A6h1,Easy to use but need preemptive alerts,3,2020-10-04 20:48:35,The real help would be knowing where not to go. Right now I believe it only sends alert after the fact.
25,26,Broken ipod touch,Battery drain,3,2020-10-08 01:28:36,This app used 56% of my battery in the background and I haven’t left the house. Would love to to use this app can’t take the battery drain.
26,27,fixedittilitbroke,Vaccination Information,3,2020-12-31 14:06:44,The app should have vaccine registration and a vaccination tracker for users to monitor the progress of NJ’s vaccination program
27,28,Neeners901,Keep getting error message,2,2020-10-28 16:39:08,"Tried downloading with wi-fi and without, just won’t load at all. Tried several times. IPhone 7"
28,29,metoo2018,3% holding,2,2020-11-07 22:58:20,Odd that after a month it constantly says 3% have mild symptoms.  You’d think it will go up or down with so many people using app.  Not sure how valid this is.
29,30,Losing fan support,Very Lackluster,2,2020-12-14 21:58:31,"Not sure why the high rating. Seems to be a useless app. Submit your symptom on a daily basis the let the app work. 
No useful interface and not very helpful."
30,31,Awesome 3101,The app doesn’t work,1,2020-10-02 21:37:48,The app doesn’t move forward your data screen. The error pops up not just on my phone but my family phone as well. Need to fix the app.
31,32,iproof4,Doesn’t work on iPhone 7,1,2020-10-03 19:43:32,Gives an error and would not let to continue with initial setup of the app on iPhone 7. Should have tested this app more before releasing it to public.

45,46,@ibawwad,Can’t get past the initial setup,5,2020-10-09 11:37:35,"UPDATE. 
Thanks for the developer reply, disconnecting the WiFi did the trick and eliminated the error, I still believe this needs to be considered, so many users would be using an International lines in the area and normally they depend on WiFi only for data connections. 
*****
I always get error code 1002 in the first page of setup, I can not get past that."

Like the idea, but can’t get started because it keeps popping up an error (code 1002). It’s at the first page asking for permission to share app usage statistics. Will check back periodically and update this review once I get in."
60,61,David cohen.,Error code turn off WiFi,3,2020-10-05 11:26:17,"As many people say before. Error code 1002 I turned off
My WiFi and it works.  You’d think they would say ‘turn off your wifi ‘ instead of some stupid code 1002 error. I mean. Come on.  
Otherwise 
I now have it installed 
No clue what it’s going to really tell me or help with as if I wouldn’t know if my neighbors got it. But I can see why in more dense and populated areas not everyone knows everyone. So I hope it helps and is not just another data mine privacy worry."
