She tested positive, I went through the process of telling the app she was positive. And I never received a notification that I had been exposed. I noticed that her bluetooth was off. I turned it back on, waited a couple of days and tried the notification process again and verified that her bluetooth was still on. I still didn't get an exposure notification. I've been a big advocate for this technology... Why isn't it working?"
