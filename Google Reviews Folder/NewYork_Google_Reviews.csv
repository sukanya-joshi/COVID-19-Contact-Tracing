The worst part was getting tested which seemed like it was more difficult then it needed to be and finding a testing cite was annoying and Imo this is a PUBLIC health crisis and ALL testing should be free. I had to go to a place and pay for a test. I was satisfied with this app because I was warned! So for that I'm happy. I was able to be proactive. I was negative in the end so this worked at least for me.

Tried to send a notification to all codes I've come into contact with and app requires 6 digit code from a contact tracer. 1. So I'm going to sit here not being able to notify anyone until a contact tracer calls me? A day can mean the difference between life and death. 2. Give us the option to edit our symptoms today. I usually do it in the morning but developed a symptom this afternoon but it was too late, I had already submitted for the day."

They can easily lie and say no. It be nice that the GPS (Location) when on and at a house can notify you of a positive person in that household or residence or a location address. That information is out there vs relaying on someone else phone and hoping they have the app to talk.

Nowhere did I do so much as insinuate that the app was for medical diagnosis. I know exactly what the app is meant to do, & insulting my intelligence is not going to hide the fact that the app is useless & does not do the job. They still haven't fixed anything. Literally thousands of complaints similar to mine & they still don't get it. The entire point is that chronically ill people ALREADY HAVE BASELINE SYMPTOMS, and if those aren't entered into ANY tracing application, the RESULTS WILL BE WRONG. How are you allowed to work on this app or respond to questions without that basic understanding? This is very definition of ableist trash. I stand by my original review: Absolutely worthless garbage. They don't listen & things keep getting worse. Inexcusable incompetence. I dont want your lying responses, I want you to do your job or get out of the way so someone who can has the chance to fix your mess. This is ridiculous. *** Original review: How can you possibly do anything like this without first allowing for a person's baseline health? I've got chronic conditions that share C19 symptoms. This app now thinks I've got C19. This is thoughtless, ableist, privileged foolishness. Throwing the chronically ill under the bus, as always. Why do you refuse to learn? Uninstalled. I want to be part of the solution, but your ignorant gatekeeping shuts me out. Nice job."
