Calling the number provided just gave you the run around with multiple prompt options, none of which were to obtain a pin. Calling the local health department was just as big of a joke as none of the 3 people I spoke to, including a nurse on call, knew of a pin that I needed to report a case. What's the point of a tracking app if it's this difficult to report when you've had a positive test? Uninstalled this useless app!"

To report your positive test it says that the Health Department will contact every positive person and give you a code. Its been over 3 weeks since my positive test and no call from anyone. So how is it suppose to let people know if they have been exposed. Another waste of time by the state.

I've had my rapid results for 5 days and send out results for 3 days, but can't report anything without a code from the health department. Makes the app completely pointless. Update 12/15: I never got any call from the health department, so never got a PIN. The app specifically says they will call. If resources weren't available to keep up with issuing PINs, the app shouldn't have been released."
