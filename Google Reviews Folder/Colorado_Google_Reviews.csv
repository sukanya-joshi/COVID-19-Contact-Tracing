Why haven't they partnered with testing facilities to provide this code automatically upon getting a positive result? I've had this app for months and haven't gotten a single notification ever"

It's never reported a possible exposure until today. There is a zero chance that I don't encounter at least one covid positive person within a hundred feet of myself on a daily basis. The possible exposure was seven days prior to the notification. It said to quarantine immediately... Seven days ago. Yikes.

When you pass by someone in bluetooth range, it will share your current number with them. If they report positive, all numbers they have been around will be notified of the positive test. No names, no locations. Simple, private, secure. I like it."

I would also like to see the areas in which covid is reported and numbers. This app seems pretty useless. I hope we as coloradoans aren't having to pay for this. It's clearly broken and doesn't work.

I think they could do a better job informing people on how they get the code to start the notification part though. For those interested, the health department can generate the code for you when you receive a call from a contact tracer. You cannot just trigger it based on a positive test result. Please answer the phone when they call after you have been tested or call them back."

If you read the reviews here very few negative reviews actually have anything to do with the app itself or it's capabilities.

The FAQ site did not have any info on where I could find a confirmation code to report a positive test; I found the answer in the freaking app reviews (CDPHE will eventually text you the code).

But don't go into the app because you'll get stopped at the verification code part. Instead wait for a text message from the health department - click on that link and follow the steps. It does share that way! You'll even see evidence that it was shared in the app. Would have given 5 stars but no explanation about the verification code or follow up text was given.
