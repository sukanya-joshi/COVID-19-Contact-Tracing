My husband tested positive on 1-02-20, and the healthcare providers never reported his positive results to anyone. As a matter of fact, he has several coworkers that also tested positive and I don't think their positive results were reported either. No wonder covid keeps spreading in Maryland! Typical Maryland department of health. (Can't say that I am surprised!)"

My biggest gripe is no feedback on the number of contacts made. It would be good to know how many people I have passed by that use or do not use the app in a given day. Why trust the app if I have no idea if it is registering or missing the people I pass by? There aren't even numbers on how effective this app is for me or everyone in general.

The sensitivity and specificity of COVID19/SARS2 testing done by PCR is questionable. It is traditionally a quantitative test NOT a qualitative one used for ID. Viral culture is the gold standard. App presumably works by your phone's bluetooth communication with COVID + patient's phone. This function may not work properly. I have my doubts. Anyway, most people survive. Infectious disease has been part of the human condition since the beginning of time."

The process: your health care provider reports your positive result to the MD Depth of Health and THEY text you a code to enter into the app to report your status. It took 4 days to get that code. Even after entering it, I still haven't received an exposure notification and we're together constantly. Verified all settings are correct. It actually has to work & QUICKLY to benefit individual users & public health. Extremely disappointed."

The reason I didn't give the app 5 stars is that it doesn't allow me to check in daily and report suspicious symptoms. The only thing I can report is a test result. The other thing I don't like is that there are separate apps for neighboring states. That means that I have to have multiple contact tracing apps on my phone.

Otherwise, I assume it's built on the same framework/template as many other states' apps and it remains to be seen how effective it is.If it really requires you to volunteer a positive test result, I'm not sure how they can expect much participation (or prevent trolling).Considering how little messaging I've seen and how resistant people are to even the most basic prevention, it seems like it may be a token gesture."
