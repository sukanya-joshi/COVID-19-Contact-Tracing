I'm mostly reviewing to point out a SERIOUS flaw in the design of this app. I live on the border w/ NY. NY has it's own identical app. I can not run both apps at the same time. So I have to pick between CT or NY. What is the reason for this and why is this administered by the states at all? Why isn't there a national app?
