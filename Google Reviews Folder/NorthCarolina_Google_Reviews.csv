Someone sick with Covid will not take the time to bother getting a pin. It should have been done like this... Sign up with the app with your cell phone number, you get Covid and the county health department should notify DHHS to send the exposure. This would have been easy to do using the cell phone number of the infected person. My wife had Covid and this app. She thought it updated using health department records."

Every time I call in they tell me it's going to be a few days. If you look at the reviews this seems to be the case, that they won't provide you the pin until weeks afterwards.

I finally received my positive test result four days after showing symptoms and when I called in to get my pin, I was told that I would have to wait a few days and call in again.

I've had this for a while; encouraged ppl to download it. Up until yesterday, it worked well - seemingly. It checked for exposures several times a day for the past two months or so. Last week, someone in my pod tested positive. It took her several days to put in a PIN. I've not been alerted yet (but I have isolated since her exposure and then positive test). This program has got to be faster to be effective. It's giving ppl a false of security."
