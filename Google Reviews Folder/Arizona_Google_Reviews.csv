The statewide reporting isn't up and running so I can't choose that as a region. I guess I am left out in the heat on this one. I will update to higher stars once the reporting becomes available in places besides two university regions.

Upon getting an exposure alert, I was able to view the details and severity with a simple touch. However, within the last two weeks, I noticed when I received an alert, I am unable to see the details. I am shown when it occurred, but the drop down bar showing the Transmission Risk and total time exposed is no longer available. I've tried all I can think to fix the issue, but at this point, I can no longer rely on it for accurate exposure alerts."

IMPOSSIBLE to find by simple searching for it in the app store. I had to follow internet breadcrumbs over the different sites to finally get a link to the exact app. Once here, while setting up, you need to select your location, one of which is ""State of Arizona"". But later it says that statewide implementation means that you can get alerts, but not alert anyone else. So if I'm in Prescott, and no one in Prescott can actually send an alert, what is the point????"

I will rate 5 simply for that. It definitely needs to be able to be discovered by searching 'covid arizona' or 'covid watch arizona'. I had to look it up on a search engine then go through an app store link on the dev's website to find it.

I'm not saying it should be force installed on any device but it should at /least/ be able to show up in a search ðŸ™ƒ

You need to be upfront about this. What ""region"" am I in and what ""local"" officials are you waiting for permission from? Thank you, ADHS, for replying on 10/09/20, but my point stands. There's no State of Arizona region and you need to remove that until ADHS, state and local officials, and your software developer have all made their necessary inputs to this process."

This should be launched across USA and it will help in saving allot of people from exposure of Covid-19. Everyone in Arizona should download and start using it.

What are the developers waiting for, especially with the current spike in Arizona? It dosen't do any good to share this with others if no one can add there positive diagnosis in an unsupported region (meaning the rest of the state)."

Few people in Arizona I know are aware of this app, and even if they're informed about it, it doesn't even appear in a general search with keywords. Then it will randomly inform you that you have a notification and, when you click to find out what it is, it will tell you that you have no notifications. You'll have an icon that sits in your notifications for 12 hours telling you that it's looking for exposures that can't be dismissed. Also, you can't even choose Phoenix nor Maricopa County as your location despite that being the most populous region of the state; your options are Tucson, Flagstaff, and ""State of Arizona"" which apparently isn't even functional."
