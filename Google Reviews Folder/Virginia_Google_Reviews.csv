My Wife and I contracted the virus and never did the app say we were in contact with anyone. Even when I go to report it, it says wait to contacted by the department of health, two weeks and nothing. So don't waste you time with this app and just follow the CDC guidelines to keep yourself safe."

We had a positive in our house over 2 weeks ago and VDH never provided a pin and we were never able to notify using the app which makes this whole thing useless if it can't be quickly used.

You have to wait to receive a unique six digit PIN from the Virginia department of Health in order to report a positive covid test and prevent false reporting. But my provider said they don't get that pin, and the VDH phone call I got 3 days after I tested positive didn't have it either. So just delete it this app and be safe."

They contacted me 4 days after my positive test result, but didn't have a valid PIN to give me. The contact tracer sent a request to IT to get me a PIN to send alerts. It has now been 8 days since I tested positive and 11 days since my first symptoms and I still can't warn others via the app. The app only monitors contacts for the last 14 days, so some people will never be warned."

The app is easy to use; you just go through a short setup, and then it runs quietly in the background. Hopefully that's the last you will ever hear of it. If you test positive, you can open up the app and report the test. If another app user that you were exposed to reports a positive test, you will get a notification, and then you know you need to go get tested. That's all there is to it. I see that some reviewers are complaining that it requires GPS, but I'm not sure where they are getting that, since it is patently not true. You can see that much by just checking the app's requested permissions from Android's settings menu. It does, however, require Bluetooth to be turned on, since that's how it detects the presence of other devices. TLDR: this app allows you to keep track of who you were exposed to while going out of its way to make sure that no record of either your movements or theirs is even created, let alone kept. If everyone uses it, then people who are exposed can self-isolate before they have a chance to pass the infection on, and that's a way better way to contain the disease than shutting down civilization. Use it, and you might just save a life, maybe even your own. When was the last time you did that by installing an app?"

Believe me if they're doing that they could care less anyway so they're not going to put it in the app. It's like putting a sign on their back and walk around. Even though it's the right thing to do I don't believe that someone would knowingly have it report it in an app to let everybody else know they have it and still walk around in crowds
