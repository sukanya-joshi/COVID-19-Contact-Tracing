To many people think the app will share personal information, so are unwilling to download it. This is making the app unusable as it was designed to be used. If only one person out of a hundred has downloaded it and is using it, then what use is having it on your phone?"

The last year has proven to us that we cannot rely on people to do the right thing so that makes this app double useless. This would have been far more useful if it kept the bluetooth device pinging but used every device's phone number and compared it against a database of known infected person's phone numbers.
