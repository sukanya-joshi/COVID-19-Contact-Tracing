It would be nice if I could just completely reset & start over but it won't let me do that either. Rather useless if I have to remember to manually enter where I've been.

I have to turn off and on wifi with bluetooth all the time for a chance for this app to work and log. Please allow the app to control Bluetooth and notify when it isnt truly working and option to turn on and off bluetooth automatically for it to work. Simple programing and still not working right.
