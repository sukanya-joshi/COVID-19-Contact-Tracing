App works fine and well. Many people do not understand how it works. It's not magic; it works when someone tests positive AND THEN actually submits their special code in the app. Many of the low ratings are because of dumb only. It can't sense aunt Suzie's viral load from across the room. Both parties need to be running the app!

My whole family downloaded this app. I saw my in-laws about two weeks before Christmas for about 30 minutes. A few days later my mother in law tested positive for COVID, then my father in law did too. They both reported it in the app. Of course I did not need the app to tell me I was exposed, but I had a known exposure and spent time within about 10 feet of my in laws (with a mask on), and I did not receive any notification from the app that I had been exposed. Ineffective."

It sends a push notification everytime it checks to see if your exposed, without any way of changing it to only alert if potentially exposed. It just went off at 01:30 (in the morning) and all it was doing was checking, which isn't cool. Also, you actually have to add your test results, so someone who's positive still might be considered negative on the app. I'd give 5 stars otherwise."

I did the setup when I got the app. I then turned off my Bluetooth and location. I don't need them on in the house.

But since it's immediately dismissed, I'm sometimes left wondering what just caused my phone to buzz. It might be better to move that to a dedicated log screen. It's good to know that the app is doing something, but that doesn't feel like the right way to show it. At least disable the vibration."

Passing by a device doesn't meet the criteria for exposure; you have to be within 6 feet of the other device for a period of time to trigger a notification. Also, you control what each app on your phone is able to do with the location setting within that app. Either yes, only when in use, or deny...it's not about ""fear""."

My one issue is that I took a Covid test through an MDH testing site and my test results don't have a verification code. Without a verification code I can't enter my results in the app. Seems strange that we can't plug our MDH test results into our MN app. Hopefully they'll fix that!

Old review: ""Like the app, easy to use, pleasant interface. However, I was exposed about a month ago. It alerted me correctly, but it never cleared/updated the exposure notice. It says ""Possible exposure 7-14 days ago"". So after your first possible exposure, you'll be tempted to ignore it. It would be more effective if it either said ""Possible exposure between ""11/14 and 11/21"" or simply added a timestamp to each exposure notification."""

But a new bug has emerged. It's no longer updating my exposure checks. The notification stays active and can't be dismissed. I am uninstalling until it can be fixed. Don't feel like seeing a constant notification but isn't actually checking my exposure.
