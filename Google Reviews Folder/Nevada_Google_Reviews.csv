Then I caught the coronavirus and it was EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to report a covid positive. You have to have a verification code to report your covid diagnosis and the clinics have NO CLUE on how to give you the code. I had to call the Nevada State DHHS and thankfully a really nice guy called back and gave me a code, and my roommate a code too BUT the app STILL isn't reporting Covid encounters!!"

I called all over the place and sent out emails and got no closer ro alerting people until 6 days after my positive test when the Washoe County Health department called for contact tracing and gave me the code. So it appears that the app works but you probably won't be notified about exposures for about a week after someone tests positive
