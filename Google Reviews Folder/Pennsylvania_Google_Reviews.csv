They only tell you the total death count up to the current date. Because of this the app doesn't exactly tell you the whole situation currently. In begining I actually liked the way app, but since of the many changes that isn't the case anymore. I feel as if they are trying to hide the real truth to the situation & that isn't a good thing at all."

I have experienced no battery drain on my phone. The battery use is less then 1 minute today and only 0.1% of my total battery use since last charge. So far no exposure notifications and I hope it stays that way.

My issue is that it requires bluetooth to run constantly and that really takes a toll on device battery life. If your phone dies or power is very low, you can't use the app. Try to make this more device resource friendly. I can imagine some devices losing power rather quickly as a result of keeping bluetooth on for long periods of time, and most people will use this when they are on the go and charging is limited. *Show check count - main page"
